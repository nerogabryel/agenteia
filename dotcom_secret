**SECTION ONE:**

**LADDERS AND FUNNELS**

## SECRET #1:

## THE SECRET FORMULA

It was 11:27 a.m. on a Monday morning, and no matter what I told myself, I
just couldn’t

get out of bed. The muscles in my body ached, although it didn’t make
sense. I knew I wasn’t sore from exercise because I hadn’t worked out. I
had a sick feeling in my stomach

that felt like the flu, but I knew I wasn’t sick. In my head, I was WISHING
that I had a

boss, so he could fire me and end this nightmare that I knew I had to face as
soon as I finally stumbled out of bed.


How had I gotten here? Just a few years earlier, I had “officially” become
an entrepreneur and launched my own company. And despite a lot of
mistakes along the way,

I had learned a few tricks and was having success. The company I started
was profitable.

We were serving people and making a difference, but for some reason, I
was miserable.

A few weeks later, I found myself in front of a huge, blank whiteboard
trying to sketch out why I was feeling this way. Something was wrong with
my business, and I wanted to figure out what it was. After what seemed like
hours, I wrote down two words:

Who?

Where?

I asked myself, “WHO is the person I really want to work with?” Up to that
point in

my business, I had been trying to sell to anyone and everyone I could.
While that sounds

smart at first, it left me tired, frustrated, and empty inside.

After I got a good idea of WHO I would ideally work with if I had that
choice, I started to think about the RESULT I would want to give them. I
asked myself, “Where

could I serve my customer at the highest level?” I realized it wasn’t through
a product or a service. Rather, it was by giving them a result that would
change their lives. That result is where I wanted to take them.

A few minutes later, I added two more words to the board:

Where?


Bait?

Where are these people? How can I find them online? What type of bait can
I create

to attract my dream client and repel everyone else?

These questions eventually became the outline for what I now call “The
Secret

Formula,” and it’s really the first step that you HAVE to take before you can
grow any company.

**THE SECRET FORMULA**

The secret formula consists of four simple questions. These are the same
four questions that I ask anyone who hires me for personal consultations. At
the time of writing, companies pay me twenty-five thousand dollars per day
to help them understand and implement this formula and the funnels and
scripts inside of this book. Now while I know

you didn’t pay anywhere near twenty-five thousand to learn this
information and go through this process, I recommend you treat this and all
of the exercises inside of this book as if you did invest the full amount. If
you do, you will get a lot more out of the process I’m going to take you
through, and this book will become like a private, twenty-five thousand
dollar consultation with me. Okay, let me walk you through the process.

**Question #1: Who Is Your Dream Client?** The first question you have to
ask yourself is, _Who do I actually want to work with?_ Most of us start with
a product idea, never thinking about who we want as clients, customers,
vendors, and associates. But these are the people you will be interacting
with day in and day out. You’ll probably spend more time with these people
than your own friends and family. You choose your significant other
carefully, so why wouldn’t you take the same time and care in deciding

who your dream client or customer will be? If you’re just getting started,
this may not seem important. But I promise you that if you don’t


consciously choose your dream client,

one day you will wake up like I did, working with people who exhaust you
and wishing

that someone could fire you from the business you created.

After I had successfully launched my first software company, a lot of
people took notice of my success online and started asking me how I was
making money. Because I saw the demand, I thought it would be fun to
teach others how to start their own businesses online.

The good thing was there were a LOT of people who wanted to start
businesses, and

we made a lot of money teaching them. But the downside was that most of
them didn’t have any money (and couldn’t invest in the higher-ticket things
I wanted to sell). And

most had no business experience, so I had to spend tons of time on the
fundamentals, and that drove me crazy (which is why I didn’t want to get
out of bed in the mornings). I had

so much value _I wanted_ to provide people—showing how I had scaled my
companies, teaching conversion secrets and how we structure our funnels—
but 99% of my time was

spent showing them how to buy a domain and set up hosting.

I literally spent years serving these customers, and it made me miserable.
My family

suffered, and no matter how much money we made, I wasn’t happy. It took
years before I

sat back and actually thought about the WHO. I realized I had overlooked
some pretty important questions:

Who are my dream clients?


What do they look like?

What are they passionate about?

What are their goals, dreams, and desires?

After about a week of thinking about the WHO question, I sat down and
created two

customer avatars: one for the men I wanted to work with and one for the
women I wanted

to work with.

For the women, I picked a name and wrote it down: Julie. Then I listed out
the things

I knew about Julie. She is successful and driven; she has a message to
share; she values

her personal growth over money; and she’s already grown her business to at
least five figures a year.

Next, I wrote down the name Mike. Next to Mike’s name, I wrote out the
things I knew about Mike. He is a former athlete. At some point, he has
helped to change someone’s life in a small way and wants to learn how to
help more people. He values growth over money, and he’s already built his
business to at least five figures a year.

Then I went to Google images and typed in _Julie_ and the characteristics I
had written out. Within minutes, I found a picture that looked like the
women in my mind. I printed it out and hung it on my wall. I did the same
for Mike, and within minutes, I had both pictures of my dream clients
hanging on my wall.

This may seem like a silly exercise, but it’s important that you do it anyway.
Really

spend some time thinking about who you want to work with. Write out their


characteristics and then go find an actual picture to represent them. It’s
amazing how your perspective changes when you have a physical picture of
your ideal customer—instead of

a hazy, half-formed image in your head.

**Question #2: Where Can You Find Them?** The next question in the
Secret Formula

is WHERE can you find this ideal man or woman? Where do they hang out
online? Are

they on Facebook or Instagram? What groups are they part of? What email
newsletters do

they subscribe to? What blogs do they read? Are they reading _The New York
Times_ or _The Huffington Post?_ What other interests do they have? Do they
like sports or the arts? How about fishing or race cars? If you don’t know
the who, it will be hard to find out _where_ your perfect client can be found.
So make sure you know exactly who you’re trying to

attract. Then just write down a few places you think the prospect might
hang out online.

Over the next few chapters, we’re going to take a deep dive into how and
where to find

your dream clients. I’ll show you exactly where to find the people you’re
looking for.

**Question #3: What Bait Will You Use to Attract Them?** Once we know
_where_ the dream customers are, we have to create the right bait to attract
them. Your bait could be a physical book, a CD, DVD, or an audio
recording—anything that your dream customer would pay attention to and
want. As my company moved away from selling to beginners

and toward attracting dream clients, our first step was to create new bait
that would attract


“Mike” or “Julie.”

So we created a book called _DotComSecrets Labs: 108 Proven Split Test
Winners._

This bait worked great for us, because most beginners don’t know what a
split test is. But we KNEW that Julie and Mike (our DREAM customers)
would know what these terms mean and they would be hungry to get their
hands on the book. Within days of launching

this new offer, we had thousands of dream clients lining up to work with us.
When you find out what your dream clients want, it becomes very easy to
attract them. Throughout

this book, we’re going to talk more about creating the right bait. Right now,
just realize the bait has to match what your dream customer wants.

**Question #4: What Result Do You Want To Give Them?** Once you’ve
hooked your

dream customers with the perfect bait, the last question is what RESULT do
you want to

give them? I’m not talking about what product or service you want to sell
them. A business is NOT about products and services. A business is about
what _result_ you can get for your clients. Once you (and they) understand
that concept, then price is no longer a barrier.

For me, I knew that the _best_ way I can serve my dream client is to send my
team to their office and help build out their sales funnels, hire and train their
sales team, and set up systems to drive consistent leads into the company.
That is how I can have the deepest impact and serve the client at the highest
level. Ideally, it’s where I would like to take all of my customers. That type
of service is _not_ cheap, but the results I can deliver at that level are
amazing. To put it in perspective, for that service, my company charges a
retainer and a percentage of sales, which combined equal one million
dollars.


I understand that many of my customers won’t be able to pay me for that
level of service (which is why we develop other products and services), but
understanding where

you ultimately want to take the dream client is the key to this step.

Imagine that your clients could pay you anything to get a desired result.
What, then,

would you do to help guarantee their success? Where would you lead them?
What does that place look like? Keep that place in your mind; it’s the
pinnacle of success for your clients. It’s where you want to take them, and
it’s the key to this last step.

That’s it. The four steps again are as follows:

1.

Who are your dream clients?

2.

How can you find them?

3.

What bait will you use to attract them?

4.

What result do you want to give them?

I know that this exercise seems simple, but it is the key to everything else
we will be

discussing in this book. So take a few minutes now and really answer these
four questions.


**Up Next:** In the next chapter, we are going to dig a little deeper and focus
on the steps you need to follow to lead your dream customer from taking
the “bait” to consuming your

product offerings to arriving “where” you want to take them. If you
structure this correctly, people will naturally ascend to where you want
them to be. They will give you

more money, and you’ll be able to serve them at a much higher level.

## SECRET #2:

## THE VALUE LADDER

Russell, are you a smoker?”

“What?” I responded. “No, I’ve never smoked in my life ... why do you
ask?”

“Well, I noticed that your teeth are turning a little yellow, and I wasn’t sure
if you were a smoker ... or maybe you drink coffee?”

“No, I don’t drink coffee either ...,” I said. “My teeth look that yellow!?”


Those were the first words my new dentist said to me about 10 minutes into
our first

appointment.

When I started my new business a few years earlier, my wife and I had no
insurance

of any kind. I was just hustling to sell things online to try and put food on
the table.

Then about four or five years into my business, I started hiring employees.
What I didn’t realize when I first hired them was most “real” companies
give their employees benefits. Because I had never had a real job before, I
wasn’t really sure what benefits were (besides hanging out with me all day,
which I assumed was the best benefit ever!). No, they wanted health
insurance and dental insurance. So I decided to cave and get them all a

“benefits” package. Within days of getting our new dental insurance, I got a
postcard in the mail offering a free teeth cleaning.

“Sweet! We’ve got insurance. It’s a free cleaning. I’m in.”

And that’s where it all started ...

Within minutes, the dentist commented on my “yellow” teeth.

“No, I don’t drink coffee or smoke. Are they really yellow?”

“Yeah, they are. But don’t worry. If you want, I can go out back and make
some custom teeth-whitening trays for you. You’ll have to use them for a
few weeks, but if you

follow the system, your teeth will be white again.”

Well, I’m sure you know what my response was ...

“Yes, please! I don’t want yellow teeth.”


The dentist kept working on my teeth, and a little while later, he said, “So,
did you have braces when you were a kid?”

“Yeah, I did. How can you tell?”

“Well, your two bottom teeth are shifting again, and that usually happens to
people who had braces.”

“My teeth are shifting? Seriously? What can you do about that?”

“Well, if you want, I can build a retainer for you, which will help keep your
teeth in

place.”

“Yes, please!”

When I walked into the dentist office that morning, I had come in for a _free_
teeth cleaning. And in less than an hour, I walked out paying over two
thousand dollars for my

whitening kit and my new retainers. This dentist had strategically taken me
through a powerful process that I call a Value Ladder.

First, he had created bait (free teeth cleaning) that would attract his dream
client (me).

Second, he provided value to me by cleaning my teeth and noticing that my
teeth had

become yellow. Because I had received value, I naturally wanted to move
forward and get

additional value from him.

He then found another way that he could provide value to me—the retainers
—and

again, I naturally took him up on that offer as well.


Now, for many dentists, they make the most money and provide the most
value for their patients by offering cosmetic surgery. Luckily, I didn’t need
any cosmetic surgery on that visit, or I could have been out ten thousand
dollars or more.

On my way out the door, the secretary scheduled me for another
appointment six months later, adding me to their “continuity” program.
Continuity is where you continue

paying on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis until you decide to cancel.
This dentist had a perfectly executed Value Ladder (fig. 2.2).

Fig. 2.2: This is a great example of a Value Ladder for a dentist.

One of the first things I explain to people when I start working with them is
the concept of a Value Ladder, and it’s the first thing you have to build out
_before_ you can start working on any sales funnel. If you look at how we
structure it, you’ll see that on the left hand axis we have value, and on the
bottom axis we show the price (fig. 2.3).


Now, on the top right hand corner of this graph, you’ll see the big $ sign.
This is _where you want to take your client._ This is where you can provide
them the most value—

and also charge them the most.

For dentists, this is usually cosmetic surgery. For my company, it’s going
into your business to build out your sales funnels, set up your backend
systems, and generate leads

for you. We currently charge our clients one hundred thousand dollars plus
10% of their

profits (up to one million) to provide this service for them. So the total cost
to my clients is a million dollars for this service. But it’s the BEST thing I
can provide them, and it gives me the ability to serve them at the highest
level.

Fig. 2.3: You can use this same model to design your own Value Ladder for
your

business.


Now, ideally we would like to sell _everyone_ our best thing, right? You want
to serve your customers in the highest way possible. But the sad truth is that
if I were to walk up to you on the street and say, “Give me a million dollars,
and I’ll help you to grow your company,” you would either laugh in my
face or run away, thinking I was insane.

Why is that?

It’s because we just met, and so far, I haven’t provided you any value.

But if you came to my website and saw that I was giving away a free book
with 108

of my BEST split tests and all you had to do was cover the $9.95 shipping,
do you think

that you’d order it?

If you’re in my target audience you would—because the price is low, and
you have a

chance to receive some value in a non-threatening way, allowing you to see
if you like the experience. Just like I did with the dentist.

Now, if you order that book from me and receive value from it, you will
naturally want more. You’ll want to ascend my Value Ladder (fig. 2.3a) and
see if there are other ways I can provide value for you.


Fig. 2.3a: My DotComSecrets’ Value Ladder includes products and services
at all

levels, including an ongoing continuity program.

You may buy one of my home study courses or attend one of my live
events. If you

receive value from that, then you may decide to sign up for my $10,000
Ignite program, or

maybe my $25,000 Inner Circle program. And if I provide awesome value
there, then you

will naturally want to keep ascending ... and THAT is how we sell our
million-dollar packages. We provide insane amounts of value at each step of
our Value Ladder, so our clients naturally want to ascend, get more value,
and pay us more money.

Oh yeah, and just like the dentist, no Value Ladder is complete without a
good continuity program. There are many ways to structure your continuity
program. It could be


organized around software, membership sites, or ongoing coaching, but it
should be something you can bill for each month. That residual income will
become the lifeblood of

your business. For my DotComSecrets business, our main continuity
program is our software ClickFunnels, which allows people to create sales
funnels with the click of a mouse. Our clients pay us monthly to use this
software to help run their businesses. It saves them a ton of time and money
and provides us with residual income. Win-Win.

**WHAT DOES YOUR VALUE LADDER LOOK LIKE?**

Now I’m aware that everyone reading this has a different type of company.
At this point,

you’re probably trying to figure out how the Value Ladder applies to your
business. I want to share with you a story that will show you how we were
able to create a Value Ladder

for a business that doesn’t seem to have any type of ascending products or
services.

I have a chiropractor friend, Dr. Chad Woolner, whom I’ve known for a
long time. In

fact, it was his urging that got me to create this book. Like most
chiropractors, he makes his living doing adjustments for about fifty dollars
each. He runs ads, patients come in, get adjusted in about ten minutes, pay
him fifty dollars, and leave. Sometimes, if the person

has a more serious condition, Chad may put the client on a continuity plan
and have them

come in a few times a week over the next few months. But that’s about it.

One day my friend and I were talking. He wanted to know what I would do
differently


in his business if I were him. I thought it over for a few days, when a funny
thing happened. At the time, I was working with a group of wrestlers who
were training for the

Olympics. Each week a chiropractor came in and adjusted all of the
wrestlers. One week,

the regular doc couldn’t make it in. So, instead of waiting for a week, one of
the athletes jumped on YouTube, typed in “how to give a chiropractic
adjustment,” and watched a few

videos until he felt like an expert. Then he walked into the other room and
quickly adjusted everyone on the team.

Now, before I move on, I feel like I should give a disclaimer or a warning
or something. Don’t get me wrong. The point of this story is NOT to say
you should go

watch YouTube videos and then start practicing medicine! (And no emails
telling me that’s illegal or crazy ... okay?) The point is that in about thirty
minutes, someone with no formal training at all learned to do what we were
paying the chiropractor for. I started laughing, called my chiropractor friend
immediately, and told him the story.

Naturally, he wasn’t as amused as I was. He launched into a long rant about
why that

was dangerous and why we shouldn’t have done it. Then I stopped him and
said, “Look, I

wasn’t just calling to be a jerk. I want to teach you something really
powerful. You went to college for years to learn how to be a chiropractor—
yet, within thirty minutes, one wrestler was able to learn EVERYTHING
that you currently do in your clinic.”

Silence.


“I’m curious, while you were going to school, did you learn anything else
besides adjustments?”

Defensively, he started to tell me about all sorts of other things he had
learned and knew how to do.

“I spent years learning nutrition and natural healing. I can help stop
fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, and ...”

And that’s where I stopped him ...

“Have you ever provided ANY of these services to your clients? Or do you
stop giving them value after the fifty dollar adjustments?”

Now I want to pause here, because most companies I work with, even if
they think they have a Value Ladder, really only have _part_ of one. Almost
always, I spend my time working with them on adding products and
services to the front of their Value Ladders, as

well as the back.

After that discussion, I sat down with my friend and we mapped out his
current Value

Ladder. It looked kind of like this (fig. 2.4):


Fig. 2.4: At first, my friend only had one basic service. I helped him flesh
out other

offerings so he had a fully developed Value Ladder.

Then we looked at other ways he could provide more value to his clients.
We figured

out where he really wanted to take them. Ultimately, he created a new
wellness program,

for which he could charge five thousand dollars. The clients who
participated would get ten times more value from each visit to his clinic.
That was the backend—the highest point—of his ladder.

Then, after we built out my friend’s backend Value Ladder, we still had to
find an attractive frontend offer to get people through the door. A
chiropractic adjustment just isn’t that sexy. It’s not like a massage that
people enjoy getting, and it’s not like going to a traditional medical doctor
where you think you’re going to die and need some medicine fast. People
usually wait until they’re in great pain before they’ll come in for an


adjustment. Chiropractic adjustments just aren’t that exciting. If you have a
blah frontend offer, your business will always struggle.

We sat down, thought through his business, and decided that a massage
would be a good thing to offer as the frontend of his Value Ladder. People
love getting massages, and it’s bait he could use to get people into his
clinic.

Now he has two full-time massage therapists who give free massages to get
people in

the door. And just like my dentist sells teeth whitening and retainers, these
therapists are trained to feel when a person’s spine or ribs are out of place
and might need an adjustment. Then they upgrade the client to the
adjustments and then to the wellness programs (fig. 2.5).

Fig 2.5: Once my friend had a fully developed Value Ladder, his business

completely turned around.

You might be selling a book right now on the frontend and have no idea
how to build


up a backend Value Ladder. Well, what other value can you provide to
people? Can you be

more hands-on with them? Can you offer more personal attention? Can you
provide ancillary services or physical products that enhance your primary
offer? My very first information product was a DVD on how to build a
potato gun. (And that just goes to show

you can sell _anything_ online!) But I figured out how to build a Value Ladder
by also selling “Do It Yourself” plans and physical potato guns to our
customers.

The Value Ladder is the key to building your marketing funnels and
mastering

everything else I’m going to teach you in this book. This system does not
work if all you

have is one thing—like a book or an adjustment. You need to be able to
build out a full

Value Ladder. Most businesses I look at have one or two pieces of the
ladder, but they rarely have all four. Once we add in the missing pieces, the
business can start to expand

dramatically. There’s no end to the level of backend services and
experiences you can add.

If you keep providing more and more value, people will spend more and
more money to

keep working with you.

I remember paying twenty-five thousand dollars to be a part of the Bill
Glazer/Dan Kennedy Titanium Mastermind program. At the time, my
highest backend offer was five

thousand dollars. Someone in that program asked me, “So, Russell, what do
you sell _next_ to the people who paid five thousand?” I told him that I didn’t


have anything else to offer, and he responded, “Russell, that’s a five
thousand dollar buyer lead— you need to sell them something else!”

Interestingly, later that night the group (yes, the SAME group that had
already paid twenty-five thousand to be in the room) was offered a chance
to be in the movie _Phenomenon_ with Dan Kennedy for an additional thirty
thousand. And nine out of eighteen people in our group bought the offer!
That was when I realized that there really is no end to your Value Ladder.
It’s one of the reasons why we created our million-dollar

program. Imagine my shock and excitement the first time someone said
yes! A percentage of your audience will always want to pay you the
premium to get more value.

The only limit to your value offerings is your imagination. Keep thinking of
higher and higher levels of service, and you can keep charging more and
more money. There’s always something else you can offer.

**WHAT IF I DON’T HAVE A VALUE LADDER?**

Often times, it’s hard for companies to figure out how to add more offers to
their Value Ladders. Typically, the process is very easy for someone selling
information products because that ascension path has already been created
and proven in thousands of different

information-based companies. But what if you’re selling something else?
What if you offer physical products, ecommerce, B2B services, or
professional services where the path

isn’t quite as clear? Sometimes it takes a little thought and creativity.

If you already have a product or a service that you sell in the middle of your
ladder,

what type of “bait” could you create to attract your dream customer? I have
a friend who


owns a company that makes custom suits for people. He was stuck selling a
high-end service but unable to see how to construct a solid Value Ladder
(probably because the

“front” at the time was two thousand dollars). After a while, my friend tried
giving away

free cuff links online. He put the offer up, started to advertise, and within
days, he had generated hundreds of perfectly qualified leads. He then took
those people through an ascension plan to get them to purchase their own
custom suits.

Often times, companies have a frontend product but nothing more to sell on
the backend. For that, I love to look at what else they could bundle together.
Could they offer a coaching program? How about a live event? What other
results or value could they give

their clients?

I told you earlier that FitLife.tv’s core issue was not a traffic or conversion
problem.

The only real problem was that they had no Value Ladder. Because of that,
they couldn’t

build out a true sales funnel. They brought people into their funnel, but then
the relationship ended. People wanted to give them money, but there was no
clear path for them to follow. As soon as they added those things into their
business, customers naturally started to ascend the ladder, ultimately paying
Drew and his team what they were worth.

While it’s not always obvious what you can add to the frontend or the
backend of your company, I promise that the solutions are there. I also
know that if you want to succeed and beat out your competition, you need
to have this Value Ladder in place.

**Up Next:** In the next chapter, we are going to talk about the basics of
building out your sales funnel. But please take the time to fill out your own


Value Ladder. Again, unless you have a complete Value Ladder, it’s
impossible to build out an effective sales funnel.

## SECRET #3:

## FROM A LADDER TO A FUNNEL

The Secret Formula was created to help you figure out who you want to
serve, how to find

them, what kind of bait you should use to attract them, and where you want
to take them.

The Value Ladder was created to help you figure out what products and
services you

need to add so that your dream clients move from your bait to your high-
end services.

Now it’s time to bridge the gap between a Value Ladder and a sales funnel.
In sections

3 and 4 of this book, we will go into a lot of detail about the strategy,
psychology, and tactics you need to build out your own sales funnels. But
first, I need you to understand

what a sales funnel is and how that relates to everything we’ve discussed so
far. This section is short, but critical to your success.


In a perfect world, I would immediately be able to talk my dream client into
purchasing my best, most expensive service. But as we discussed in the last
chapter, that’s almost impossible because I haven’t provided value yet.
Besides, my highest-level service

might not be the best fit for all people. It’s almost impossible to build a
company just offering your high-end services. You need a full range of
offers. So instead of trying to convince someone to buy the most expensive
offering right away, we build a funnel that

will help us to do two things:

1.

Provide value to each customer at the unique level of service that he or she
can

afford.

2.

Make money and be profitable while identifying our dream clients who can

afford our highest offer.

The best way to show you how this works is to draw a funnel:


Fig 3.2: A funnel moves people through the sales process. They enter as

prospective customers (traffic), and your job is to convert as many as
possible into

repeat customers by selling to them at the front, middle, and backend of
your

funnel.

Above the funnel is a cloud that represents all of my potential customers. At
the top

of my funnel is the “bait” that will attract my dream customers. Notice that
this bait is also the first rung of the Value Ladder. As I start to place ads
featuring my bait, potential customers will start raising their hands, and a
certain percentage of those people will purchase my frontend offer.

Then I will move to the next step in my funnel. Here I will introduce the
next product


or service in my Value Ladder. This will, of course, be something offering
MORE value,

while also costing more money. Unfortunately, not everyone who purchases
my bait will

also purchase this more expensive, high-value product, but a certain
percentage of those people will.

From there, I move deeper into the funnel and introduce the next product or
service

on my Value Ladder. Again, not everyone will buy this product, but a
percentage of the clients who initially took the bait will. I will continue to
do this through all the levels of my Value Ladder, and at the bottom of this
funnel, a handful of people will appear who can afford—and may be willing
to purchase—my high-end services. These are my dream

clients, the ones I want to work with at a more intimate level.

Now, before I “sell” you on why you need to be thinking about your
company in terms of “funnels,” I want you to understand that my approach
wasn’t always this detailed.

When I first got started online over a decade ago, there was a lot less
competition. I could have just a frontend product, and I’d spend a dollar on
ads and make two dollars back in

return. But as more people started businesses online and competition started
to grow, ad

costs went up, the consumer’s buying resistance also went up, and it got
harder to sell.

People I know who were making millions of dollars a year are no longer in
business because they didn’t adapt and change with the times.

When I started to feel the pinch, I was lucky enough to have some amazing
mentors


who taught me the importance of building a deeper funnel with more
offerings. The deeper your funnel is, and the more things you can offer your
clients, the more each customer will be worth to you. And the more they are
worth to you, the more you can spend to acquire them. Remember this
truth:

_“Ultimately, the business that can spend the most to acquire a customer
wins.”_

**—Dan Kennedy**

Every product I sell online has a sales funnel that I take people through. In
fact, immediately after the customer buys something, they are offered an
upsell or two before

they even leave the page. This is one type of sales funnel. But after they
have purchased

something from me, I use other types of communication funnels to build a
relationship and

encourage them to purchase other products and services that we sell. You’ll
learn about these special communication funnels in Section 2. Every
product we sell has its own sales

funnel to provide value and convert the buyer into a higher-end customer.
You’ll see all seven of these funnels in Section 4.

The fact that you picked up this book and are reading it now is proof that
this concept

works. I already know that a percentage of everyone who buys this book
will upgrade to

one of my online web classes. I also know that from there, a percentage of
those people

will upgrade to my Ignite program or my Inner Circle program. And a few,
the ones who


are the right fit, will join my million-dollar program, and I’ll be coming out
to set up this whole system in their offices.

**Let’s Review:** So a sales funnel is just the online process you take someone
through to get them to ascend through the different levels of your Value
Ladder. It’s the actual webpages that will make the Secret Formula work.
The Secret Formula will help you find

your dream customer, offer them your bait, and lead them to where you
want them to go—

all while providing the customer value and making you money.

**Up Next:** So, the next logical question, after you understand the concept
behind the sales funnel, is WHERE do you find the people to put into that
sales funnel? Secret #4 will present three simple questions to help you find
your dream clients and bring them to your

websites— with credit cards in hand.

## SECRET #4:

## HOW TO FIND YOUR DREAM CUSTOMERS

With the Secret Formula, you discovered that you must find out _who_ your
dream clients are and then find out _where_ they are. Usually my clients can


figure out pretty quickly who they want to sell to, but they get stuck
figuring out where those dream clients are and how to get them to visit their
websites. The process of getting people to come to your website is called
“driving traffic.” So when I talk about “traffic” throughout this book, I’m
talking about the people you are convincing (through an ad) to come to your
website. People always ask me how to attract more traffic to their websites,
but before we can address how to get those people, you have to understand
the concept of “congregations.”

One of the coolest things about the Internet is the power of congregations.
These seemingly unimportant groups of people gathering together in little
corners of the Internet make it possible for people like you and me to get
into business quickly and be successful without all the barriers and
expensive hurdles of traditional media.

When I say the word _congregation,_ what’s the first thing that pops into your
head?

For most people, the word _congregation_ brings to mind a church. A church
is really nothing more than a group of people who gather together based on
similar beliefs, values,

and ideas. For example, each week, the Baptists all congregate together
based on their similar beliefs and values. The Catholics also congregate
together and so do the Mormons,

Seventh Day Adventists, Muslims, and Jews, etc., ... right? So, if I were
selling a perfect

product for Mormons, where would I go to sell it? Of course, I would go to
the Mormon

Church. My dream customers would be right there congregated together.
All I’d have to

do is put my message out in front of them.


My point is not to teach you how to sell things to churches. I want you to
understand the power of a congregation because it’s one of the main reasons
the Internet is such an

amazing tool for businesses. Prior to the Internet, it was hard for people
around the world to congregate together. We were limited by location and
ability to communicate. But now

it’s possible for anyone and everyone to congregate together and discuss
almost anything

with groups of people who hold similar beliefs.

When I was in high school, there were five or six kids who would get
together every

day at lunch and play card games. I remember one of the games was called
Magic: The Gathering. Now I had never heard of it, and I thought the kids
were kind of strange sitting by themselves playing cards. But they were
content to congregate together and participate

in an activity they enjoyed. I’m sure there were a handful of kids in high
schools all over the country doing the same thing, unaware of one another.
Before the Internet, that was how things worked. You were kind of limited
based on geography; you might not be close

to other people in your congregation. As a marketer, I would have found it
difficult to reach five kids at one high school and three at another school
and six or seven at yet another. It would have cost too much money to be
successful. Yet now, thanks to the Internet, those five or six kids in my high
school can congregate with others all over the world to play Magic: The
Gathering online. They can hang out on forums and play games

with people half way across the world. Now, if I have a product to sell to a
congregation

of people who love Magic: The Gathering, it’s easy and economical to go
online, find where they are, and get my message in front of them.


Here’s another example: I was a wrestler in college, and every night all the
student athletes had to spend two hours in study hall to make sure we got
our homework done.

Naturally, I would sit next to my wrestling buddies, and we’d goof off
online. I remember

looking over one day and noticing that all my friends were looking at the
exact same website I was. It was called TheMat.com—a website for
wrestlers. We were all chatting about what had happened that month in the
world of wrestling and who was winning. We

were showing cool moves and discussing what move might work better.
Every single person on my college wrestling team was in that study lab for
two hours every night hanging out on TheMat.com and talking about
wrestling—rather than doing our homework.

Interestingly, this was probably happening in every single university around
the country. Add in all the high school wrestlers and any older people
interested in the sport who would likely find this site, and you can see that
potentially every single wrestler in the world could congregate in one spot
and talk about wrestling. Now, if I had a wresting

product, what would I do to sell it? I would find the existing congregation
of wrestling fans, and I would put my message out in front of them. Simple!

There are congregations for _everything_ you can dream up—from antiques
buyers to zipper collectors. Once you understand the core concept of
congregations, driving traffic is incredibly easy. Not sure where your
congregations are? Just go to Google and type in your keywords plus the
word _forum_ or search for groups related to your keywords on Facebook. It
might take a little digging, but you’ll find your target audience. Now, there

are three questions you have to ask yourself to find and really tap into these
congregations.

**QUESTION #1: WHO IS YOUR TARGET MARKET?**


When I ask that question, people tend to answer with straight demographics
like, “My target market is women from ages thirty-six to forty-five who
make fifty thousand dollars

a year.” For a very long time, straight demographics like that were pretty
much the only

way to separate the people you wanted to target from the rest of humanity.
Traditional media catered to certain demographics through its programming
and sold advertising along those lines. If you wanted to reach well-off,
intellectual men, you might advertise on the late night news or in _The New
York Times._ If you wanted to reach housewives, you might advertise during
a soap opera in the middle of the day. Unfortunately, straight demographics
don’t give you any of the juicy information about the individual. In the old

days, the best you could do was group people in general terms, according to
age, gender,

income, and geographical location. The Internet has changed all that. Today
you can get as granular as you want to with the data available. You can
segment people based on musical

taste, medical background, and shoe size. If you like, you can even group
according to the movies they watched last month or the websites they
visited yesterday.

Because marketers are now able to target so many different characteristics
so

accurately, people have lost all patience for generalized, mass media
messages.

Consumers expect and demand that your advertising be _extremely_ relevant
to them. Say you own a local pet food company and your advertising speaks
to women in Tampa who

love dogs. If I’m a man in Tampa who loves cats, you might want to create
a separate message for me. It doesn’t matter that both target markets can get


food for their animals at your store. Consumers want and expect messaging
that speaks directly to them, or they will likely ignore you. There’s just too
much information bombarding us at all hours of the day and night. As
modern humans, we are subconsciously forced to screen out anything that
doesn’t directly apply to us. So a dog food commercial may not even
register on a cat owner’s radar, even though your store also sells cat food.

To create hyper-targeted messages, you have to know your target market
inside and out. Successful businesses get inside of the customer’s mind and
find out what the individual really cares about. What are their pains and
passions? What do they desire?

What do they think about, and what do they search for online? When you
can find out those tiny details, you can search more specifically and find
buyers in not-so-obvious places. For example, in the “how to make money”
business that I have, I often think back

to myself when I was a twelve-year-old kid buying stuff from infomercials.
What were my

desires? What got me excited? Where did I look for more information?
What words and

phrases was I searching for? What magazines did I read? I try to figure out
what my mindset was at the time. If I had a wrestling product, I would think
back to my own wrestling days. Who are the people in the wrestling
market? What are they searching for?

What problems do they want to solve? What questions do they need
answered? I suggest

digging into your own experience to create as detailed a picture as possible
for the product you are selling. You want to go way beyond typical
demographics when answering

question number one: Who is your target market? Then, when you have an
accurate picture, you can move on to the next question.


## QUESTION #2: WHERE IS YOUR TARGET MARKET

## CONGREGATING?

Remember your target market is made up of real people, so you need to
look at their real

behavior. Where do they hang out online? Where do they spend their time?
What email newsletters might they subscribe to? What blogs do they read?
What Facebook groups are

they a part of? Are they even on Facebook—or do they prefer Instagram?
What keywords

are they searching for on Google? What books are they buying on Amazon?
Answering these questions can take some time and research, but it’s worth
taking as much time as you need to develop a clear picture of where your
ideal clients are directing their attention.

Finding traffic on the Internet really is as easy as answering these questions.

Marketers try to make it complicated with all of the technology that helps
direct the traffic to certain web pages. But it’s your knowledge of the _people_
in your market that makes the technology useful. I like to think of the
Internet as a huge mountain, and your ideal customer—your traffic—is gold
inside that mountain. Your job as a marketer is to find the

gold and mine it out. When you start mining, you’re just digging around,
poking and prodding, trying to find where the gold is. You know there’s
gold in that mountain somewhere, but you’re not sure where. So you’re
looking around, trying this area and that

area, and all of a sudden, you might dig up a few nuggets. Typically, gold
clumps together in a vein running through the mountain (like a
congregation). So when you find a little bit of gold, you can dig deeper and
find more. You’ll soon see that the vein runs deep into the mountain. If you
keep following that vein, you can mine out all the gold. It’s worth taking the


time to do a thorough job in the poking and prodding stage. Because if you
can find

exactly where your target market is hanging out, then pulling out the gold is
simply a matter of putting a relevant message in front of them and directing
them to your offer.

Do some digging—all the while asking the crucial questions: _Who is my
target market? Where are these people congregating?_ You search for a little
while, and Boom!

You might find an email newsletter they subscribe to. That’s a vein of gold.
You’re going

to tap into that. You might buy ads in that newsletter and try to entice all
those people back to your website. You might find a blog they frequent or
maybe a Facebook group they like. As the entrepreneur, it’s your job to go
out there and find these congregations. There are people you can hire to
help, and there are systems you can set up to tap into those congregations,
but first you have to get into the mindset of the target market and figure out
where they congregate.

Then you’re ready for the third question.

**QUESTION #3: HOW CAN YOU GET A CUSTOMER TO LEAVE
THE**

**CONGREGATION AND CHECK OUT YOUR PAGE?**


If I’m in the middle of a wrestling debate on TheMat.com, it’s going to take
something special to get me to leave that site and go look at something else.
At this point, you have to figure out what offering is special enough to
entice a wrestling fan away from his favorite site. How can you divert
attention away from what your prospect is currently doing? I call this
process the Enquirer Interrupt.

Fig 4.2: Your ads must be able to grab people’s attention if you want them
to click

over to your site.

Did you know that _The National Enquirer_ is one of the most read
newspapers in the

world? They place their publication in one of the busiest spots on earth: the
checkout stand. People only have a split second to make a buying decision,
so the publication offers short two-to three- word headlines that will stop
almost anyone in their tracks. The magazine is an undisputed master at
interrupting your brain patterns and making you notice.

Your job online is almost the same. You are trying to engage someone who
is already


checking email, Facebook, and his cell phone at the exact same time. You
have to interrupt potential customers long enough for them to click on your
ad and visit your website.

As you start to think about what type of ads should you be placing—what
they should

say, what types of images they should use—I recommend going to Google
images and searching for “National Enquirer headlines.” You’ll see
hundreds of examples that you can

model. If you look closely, you’ll notice the magazine always uses a strange
or unusual picture to grab the eye. Then it uses short, punchy headlines
(usually describing something weird, unusual, or shocking) to make you
curious enough to buy a copy. The images and

headlines interrupt whatever you were thinking about to make you pay
attention to the product, a magazine.

In our ads, we place these Enquirer Interrupts to grab our prospects’
attention and send them to our squeeze pages, our frontend offers, and our
bait. Remember that just because you’ve identified _who_ your dream
prospects are and _where_ they are, your job isn’t done. You still need to grab
their attention and get them to click over to your website. You

do that through these interrupt-style ads.

**YOUR ROLE AS THE ENTREPRENEUR**

As the entrepreneur for my companies, one of my primary jobs is to
identify where the veins of gold are located. This task is not for the person
buying the ads, optimizing the ads, or picking the keywords, etc. That’s like
expecting a building contractor to know how to pour the foundation, frame
the house, put up the sheet rock, and run the electricity. A contractor does
not need to know how to do all of those things to build a house. In fact, if
he did do all of those things, it would take ten times longer to get the job
done. Instead, he understands the pieces that need to be in place to build a


house, and then he hires the electrician to do the wiring and the sheet rock
guy to put up the sheet rock.

Your job as the entrepreneur is to understand the strategy behind these

DotComSecrets and then hire the Facebook guy to run Facebook ads and
the Google guy

to run Google ads. To this day, I’ve never once run a Google or a Facebook
ad, yet I’ve

made millions on both platforms. I understand the strategy, and then I set up
systems and

hire people who are great at the tactics. In this way, we all do what we are
best at.

Because I know this division of labor works, I’m not going to go into every
detail on

how to run the ads in this book. Instead, I want to focus on the strategy.
Then, you can build a system and have your team help you to implement it.
In the next chapter, I’m going to help you understand the strategy behind
the three types of traffic, and we will pinpoint your ONLY goal when
driving traffic online.


## SECRET #5:

## THE THREE TYPES OF TRAFFIC

Acrucial DotComSecret you must understand to experience exponential
growth is this: There are only three types of traffic:

1.

Traffic you control

2.

Traffic you don’t control

3.

Traffic you OWN

Once you understand how each type of traffic works and how they tie
together, you

will have the ability to direct the right traffic to the right offers, and convert
the highest number possible into buyers and repeat clients. Your one and
ONLY goal is to OWN all

the traffic you can. That is how you grow your list and increase your sales.

**TRAFFIC YOU OWN**

I want to begin our discussion with the third type of traffic listed above
because it’s the most important. Traffic you own is the BEST kind of traffic.
It’s your email list or your followers, readers, customers, etc. I call this the
traffic that I “own” because I can send out an email, post a message to my
followers, or make a blog post, and I will generate instant traffic. I don’t
have to buy it from Google or Facebook. I don’t have to do any PR or SEO.

This is my own distribution channel; I can send out messages anytime I
want, with no new


marketing costs. I can sell things to these people over and over again, and
all of that

money comes back as pure profit.

I was lucky when I first got started online to have a mentor named Mark
Joyner. Mark

had built a huge company online, and when I started to study under him, his
number one

piece of advice to me was this: “Russell, you have to build a list.” He
ingrained that principle into my mind, and it became my only focus for two
to three years. As my list started to grow, so did my income.

The first month, I was able to get about two hundred people to join my list,
and I made just a little over two hundred dollars that month. When I had
increased my list to about one thousand people, I started to average about
one thousand dollars per month.

When I got my list to ten thousand people, I was averaging over ten
thousand dollars per

month! And those numbers have stayed pretty consistent now that we have
well over five

hundred thousand people on the lists.

Yes, we average about one dollar per month for each name on our email
lists. In some

of the markets we’re in, the profit is actually a lot higher than that. But as a
rule of thumb, when you follow the communication funnels you’ll learn in
Section 2 correctly, you should expect to see similar results. Once you
understand that metric, suddenly list building becomes a much higher
priority!

That’s why it’s so important to convert the other two types of traffic (both
traffic you


control and traffic you don’t control) into subscribers and buyers (traffic
that you own) as quickly as possible. The bigger your list, the more money
you make.

**TRAFFIC YOU CONTROL**

The next type of traffic is traffic you control. You control traffic when you
have the ability to tell it where to go. For example, if I purchase an ad on
Google, I don’t own that traffic (Google does), but I can control it by
buying an ad and then sending those who click on

that ad anywhere I want. Any kind of paid traffic is traffic you control,
including the following:

-

Email ads (solo ads, banners, links, mentions)

-

Pay-per-click ads (Facebook, Google, Yahoo, etc.)

-

Banner ads

-

Native ads

-

Affiliates and joint ventures

Now, I personally LOVE traffic that I can control, but my big problem is
that every

time I want more of it, I have to spend more money. So my goal is always
to send any traffic that I am going to purchase over to a type of website we


call a “squeeze page.”

(We’ll discuss squeeze pages a lot more during Secret #11: The Twenty-
Three Building Blocks of a Funnel.)

Fig. 5.2: Squeeze pages have one goal, and no distractions. There is only
one

thing for the visitor to do on this page.

This squeeze page is a very simple page with ONE goal: to convert traffic
that you control into traffic that you own. I send all of my paid traffic to a
squeeze page, and when the visitors get there, they only have ONE option:
give me an email address or leave. Now

a certain percentage of people will leave, but the cool thing is that some of
those people will give you a personal email address. After that, the traffic
you control becomes traffic that you own, and you can start sending the new
potential buyer through your Soap Opera


Sequences (Secret #7) and your daily Seinfeld emails (Secret #8).

**TRAFFIC YOU DON’T CONTROL**

This last type of traffic just shows up, and I don’t have any control over
where it came from or where it goes. For example, if someone mentions my
book on Facebook, their followers may search my name in Google, and
they may land on some random page in my

blog. I didn’t have control over any part of that sequence of events. There
are lots of types of traffic that I don’t control, including:

-

Social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest,
etc.)

-

Search traffic (search engine optimization or SEO)

-

Guest blog traffic

-

YouTube

-

Guest interviews

Now, just like traffic that I control, my ONLY goal with traffic that I don’t
control is

also to turn it into traffic that I own. To do this, I try to push all traffic that I
don’t control


back to my blog. If you visit any of my blogs, you’ll notice that the top
third of my blog is nothing but a glorified squeeze page. When people go
there, the only real thing they can

do is give me their email addresses. After they do that, they become traffic
that I own, and I can put them into my communication funnels.

Fig. 5.3: I turn my blog posts into modified squeeze pages to convert as
much

traffic as possible into traffic I own.

**MOVING INTO YOUR COMMUNICATION FUNNEL**

**Up Next:** Now that you understand where you can find congregations
composed of dream clients and you understand that your goal is to convert
those people into traffic that you own, the next question is, _What do you do
with the potential customers after they join your email list?_

Section 2 of this book will show you how we communicate with our
audience. It will


detail what emails we send out and in what sequence we send them. It will
show you how

to use your email list as a tool to get people to ascend your Value Ladder.
But before we

get into the actual sequences that you’ll be sending out (Secret #7 and #8),
you first have to understand the Attractive Character.

PARTE 2


**SECTION TWO:**

**YOUR COMMUNICATION FUNNEL**

## SECRET #6:

## THE ATTRACTIVE CHARACTER

Hey Russell, I’m building a list, but nobody’s opening my emails. Nobody’s
clicking on

my links. Nobody’s buying what I’m trying to sell. What am I doing
wrong?!”


People who started my DotComSecrets course used to express this same
thought all

the time. Business owners often get behind the idea that they should be
averaging a dollar per month for every person on their list. So, they focus
on growing their lists, yet feel stuck and frustrated when they don’t see
results. Can you relate to that at all?

In my experience, the missing link is this concept of the Attractive
Character (AC).

It’s about the persona you’re sharing with your audience and how you
communicate with

your list. Most people either don’t bother to create this character, or they
don’t do it correctly. So, I want to explain the process to you now. It’s one
of the most important steps you can take when it comes to making sales.
Once you intentionally create your AC, your

business will change forever.

An Attractive Character is not someone who is extraordinarily good
looking, although

they might be. What I’m talking about here is a persona that _attracts_ clients
or customers and helps you build your following to eventually make sales.
An Attractive Character allows you to build a platform anywhere you want,
whether on email, Facebook, or YouTube. It doesn’t matter where you show
up; your AC will draw people to you.

The first time I learned about personas and characters, I was at a marketing
seminar

and heard John Alanis speak. If you look up his name, you’ll find he
teaches men how to get women to approach them. In other words, he
teaches guys how to pick up chicks. I remember he explained how the
concept of attracting women was very similar to


attracting customers and making sales. If a guy wants a woman to be
attracted to him, there are certain things he needs to do. And they are the
same things you need to do if you want clients and customers to be attracted
to you in your business. He said entrepreneurs

need to create an Attractive Character. This was the first time I had ever
heard anyone talk about this idea. I listened to him talk for an hour, and it
made a huge impact on me and my company.

Think about any business—online or offline. Most successful ones have an
Attractive

Character front and center. Take Subway, for example. Subway used to be
just another fast

food restaurant like McDonald’s, Burger King, and all the rest. Then
somewhere along the

line, the company found this guy named Jared. He was a big guy who
weighed over four

hundred pounds. However, he started eating nothing but Subway twice a
day, and over the

course of a couple of years, he lost a ton of weight. Subway shared Jared’s
story with the world. They put him in commercials, on billboards,
everywhere. By making Jared their Attractive Character, Subway
transformed its business from an average fast food

restaurant to a weight-loss plan. This new tactic completely set the
company apart from the competition. One of the reasons that Subway does
so well is because it focuses marketing tactics around an Attractive
Character. People trying to lose weight can relate to Jared. They understand
his backstory, and they want to be like him. If this guy could lose all that
weight just by eating Subway twice a day, then they can too. This same guy
has

been bringing in business for Subway for over fifteen years!


Now think about your favorite movies. What was the last movie you saw?
Did you see it because you thought the storyline was intriguing? Or did you
go because one of your favorite actors or actresses was in it? Movies use
Attractive Characters because those ACs bring in the customers. A great
example of that concept is the movie _Ocean’s Eleven._

When I saw the lineup for that movie, I had no doubt it would be
successful. Producers brought in eleven Attractive Characters, actors who
viewers already loved, put them together in a movie, and Boom! Instant hit.
Maybe you’re not a big Brad Pitt fan, but you

love everything Julia Roberts does. So, you go see the movie because she is
the Attractive Character you relate to.

This is why sequels and franchises work so well, generation after
generation. If you

loved Harrison Ford as Han Solo in 1977, you probably paid to see all the
_Star Wars_ sequels and _Raiders of the Lost Ark,_ too. And guess what? Nearly
forty years later, guess who’s showing up again to bring you a little more
Han Solo? It’s amazing to think that one mediocre movie created over a
generation ago can still pack the theaters and sell tickets by the millions.
That’s the power of Attractive Characters. We love them. We want to be
like

them. We relate to their stories. And we buy what they’re selling!

This is one of the big secrets behind the most successful online businesses
in the most

competitive markets, like weight-loss, dating, financial investing,
supplements, and ecommerce. All these types of businesses can use an
Attractive Character.

I started noticing how this works in my own business when I started
speaking at seminars and selling products from the stage. The first few
times I spoke, I was still in school at Boise State University. I was a student


athlete in the wrestling program, and that information would come out
when I told my story from the stage. I talked about wrestling

and coaches and lessons I’d learned from the sport. When it was time to sell
at the end of the presentation, I noticed that the people who came to the
back to buy my product were

mostly male athletes. They would say, “Hey, man, I played football in
college.” Or, “Hey,

I’m a lacrosse player.” I didn’t realize it at the time, but my story was
promoting an Attractive Character that other male athletes could relate to.
Interesting.

A few years later, my wife and I were trying to start a family. Like so many
couples

these days, we had some trouble getting pregnant. We went through a long
process, but after a few months with a fertility doctor, we ended up getting
pregnant with twins. I remember speaking at a seminar, and for some
reason, I felt like I should tell that story. I was kind of nervous because I
didn’t usually share intimate, personal stories. But for whatever reason, I
did share that story with the audience and tied it back to my presentation.
Then I went through my sales close as usual.

When I looked to the back of the room, something weird happened. The
athletes were

still there, but now there were wives, mothers, and families buying my
products, too. I thought, _How interesting! I shared something about my
family, and suddenly there’s a new segment of the audience attracted to that
part of my persona._ This new audience segment suddenly felt they could
relate to me, so they had enough trust to purchase from me. That

had never happened before.

I remember another time when my company was launching a product called


MicroContinuity. Before we released the product, we had done a few
workshops teaching

the system to people. One student, Joy Anderson, launched a very
successful

MicroContinuity program, which is still successful today. When it came
time to launch the

product, I decided I was tired of telling my story, so I decided to tell Joy’s
story instead.

So, we launched the product and sold over eight thousand units, grossing
over a million dollars in sales in just two weeks. A few months later, we
had a workshop for people who

had bought the program. I remember being amazed as I looked out over the
audience and

saw a fifty/fifty split of men and women. Typically, my workshops are
about 90% men, but this one was totally different. At the end, we surveyed
the attendees to find out why

they had come to the workshop. Almost without exception, all the women
said, “I want to

be Joy Anderson.”

I kept seeing examples of this trend; the people who related to my stories
were the ones who bought my products. So, a few years ago, I started
teaching this concept of the

Attractive Character. The students who implemented what I’m about to
teach you here totally transformed their businesses. All of the major success
stories from any of our coaching programs got results by building huge
brands and platforms around an Attractive

Character.


This concept can mean the difference between making one thousand dollars
a month

and making one hundred thousand a month. How attractive are you? How
interesting are

you? Why would someone tune in to watch a TV special about your story?
You might be thinking, _But I’m not that interesting._ I promise that I didn’t
feel very interesting when I first started out either. But if you find ways to
share your backstory, you can make it compelling, and people will follow
you because of a personal connection.

There are three components to creating an Attractive Character:

-

Elements

-

Identity

-

Storylines

You need each of these components to round out a character people will like
and follow. In the upcoming chapters, we will discuss how to introduce the
facets of your Attractive Character to your audience, but for now, you need
to focus on building out your own Attractive Character profile. We’re going
to go through that process in detail right now.

**THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF THE ATTRACTIVE CHARACTER**

**1. Backstory.** Every good Attractive Character has to have a backstory. It’s
essential if you want results. If you turned on the TV and saw Jared sitting
there eating a sub, what


would your reaction be? You’d probably think something like, _Who’s that
annoying skinny guy just sitting there eating subs all day?_ Without knowing
his backstory of amazing weight loss, you would be unable to relate to him.
He’d just be a dude eating subs.

But if you see Jared’s backstory—pictures of him at 425 pounds and 190
pounds—

and then see him eating subs, it’s a whole different story. You might think,
_I’m just like he was. If he can lose all that weight just by eating subs, maybe
I can too. I want to be where he is._ Do you see the difference in a potential
customer’s reaction?

You share your backstory because you want people to see where you came
from. If they can relate to where you came from, then they will want to
follow you to where you

are now. If they don’t see the backstory, potential customers won’t follow
you or listen to you. You’ll seem untouchable; you won’t seem real to them.
However, if they see that you

were once in a similar situation, then they instantly identify with you and
will follow you.

Your story has provided a hook. You can then lay out the path, and they will
want to follow that path.

The key is that the story has to relate to the product you’re selling
somehow. If you’re

selling a weight-loss product, you want to talk about a weight-loss
backstory. If you’re selling investing advice, you want a financial backstory.
Does that make sense?

Now, if you don’t have a backstory that relates to your product, that’s okay.
You can


find someone else’s backstory and use that instead. This is what I did when
I shared Joy

Anderson’s story and suddenly became attractive to female buyers. Your
students, your case studies, your successful clients—those are all resources
for relatable backstories and Attractive Characters. The owner of Subway
wasn’t the guy on TV eating subs all the

time, right? It was Jared. He was the chain’s success story, so he became its
Attractive Character. Your Attractive Character does not have to be you, but
a backstory is essential.

**2. Attractive Characters Speak in Parables.** Parables are little stories,
easy to remember, that illustrate a relevant point. If you’ve been following
me for a while, you know I tell lots of stories, or parables.

For example, when I taught my Expert Secrets course, I needed a way to
show people

that they can make money with _any_ of their talents or skills. So I shared the
story, or parable, about the first product I created: a DVD about how to
make potato guns. Now, there is a lot to that story that I won’t cover here in
this book, but it illustrates the fact that you can create and make money
selling your experience or expertise in almost anything.

I have other parables that I use to teach the core principles that I want and
need my

customers to understand. Think about other teachers you’ve had in the past,
those who had

a great impact on your life. My guess is that if they had a lasting impact on
you, it’s because they taught you by using amusing and memorable stories.

A parable is a story about something that happened in your Attractive
Character’s life.


Most people let life pass them by, and they don’t stop to take note of the
interesting things that happen to them. But you’re different. You have the
ability to use the things that happen throughout your life to teach and
inspire others—as well as sell products.

Here is another example of a parable I use almost every time I sell
something. My college wrestling coach’s name was Mark Schultz. I had just
moved into the dorms and gone to my first practice where I had an
awesome time meeting my teammates and the coaches. That night, there
was a knock on my door. When I opened it, there stood Coach

Schultz. He had brought me a videotape of his own wrestling footage. I
thought that was

pretty cool, but before he left, he asked me for my wallet. When I gave it to
him, he opened it, took all of my money out, and handed me back an empty
wallet. I was kind of

confused, but too nervous to say anything. He then told me, “Russell, if I
gave you that tape for free, you’d never watch it. But because you’ve paid
for it now, you made an investment. Now I know you’re going to watch it
and learn from it.” And he was right.

Because I had made that investment, I did watch the tape over and over
again, and I became a better wrestler because of it. That’s the day I learned
the power of investment.

Now, I share that parable almost anytime I’m going to ask somebody to
make an investment with me. Because I know the potential customer wants
success, but I know they can’t have it unless they make that investment. Do
you see how sharing a parable, like the one about Coach Shultz, is MORE
powerful than just telling someone he needs to

make a personal investment?

Look through your life, and I promise that you’ll start finding these little
parables that can help illustrate important points. You can also draw
parables from the lives of others.


Just know that when you stop teaching facts and start teaching through
parables, your messages will stay with an audience longer.

**3. Attractive Characters Share Their Character Flaws.** This next
element is one that most people really struggle with sharing, but it’s one of
the most important ones to

share because it makes you relatable and real. You need to understand that
every believable, three-dimensional Attractive Character has flaws. Think
about your favorite characters in movies, books, or TV shows. Every
character that you bond with emotionally

has flaws, right? One of my favorite examples is Superman. He’s the Man
of Steel. He’s

invincible. Nobody can kill him. As a storyline, it’s not very exciting. But
when you introduce Kryptonite and his concern for the welfare of his
family, suddenly he has vulnerabilities and flaws—he becomes an
interesting character that people care about.

No one wants to hear about the perfect person—because you can’t relate.
Yet most of

us try to put on a perfect facade for our audiences, thereby alienating the
real men and women we are trying to reach. Conversely, as soon as the
audience knows you’re not perfect, that you have character flaws, then they
will start to empathize with you. They’ll like you more because you are like
them: not perfect.

**4. Attractive Characters Harness the Power of Polarity.** Another
challenge people

face when communicating with an audience is trying not to offend anyone.
So, instead of

being a relatable person, speakers become bland and stay neutral on many
topics, only sharing safe things everyone will love.


Here’s the problem. While that sounds like the logical thing to do—
appeasing

everyone—the problem is that being neutral is boring. When an Attractive
Character tries

to win the votes of everyone, they end up reaching no one.

Instead, Attractive Characters are typically very polarizing. They share their
opinions

on hard matters, and they stick to their guns—no matter how many people
disagree with

them. They draw a line in the sand. And when they take a stand for what
they believe in,

they split the audience into three camps: those who agree with them, those
who are neutral, and those who will disagree with them. As you start to
create that polarization, it will change your “fair weather fans” into diehard
fans who will follow what you say, share your message, and buy from you
over and over again.

One of the best examples of this concept is Howard Stern. He’s very
polarizing.

People either love him or they hate him. Yet, as you can see from his
following on Sirius

radio and his role on _America’s Got Talent,_ people are listening. Think
about the podcasts you listen to. Think about the blogs and books you read.
Do the Attractive Characters you

have bonded with and follow have a polarizing effect on you? Are there
people you still

follow and listen to—even though you can’t stand them or their messages?
It’s very interesting that we will spend as much time listening to, talking


about, and sharing things from people that we despise as we do treasuring
the wisdom from our favorite people. Yet,

if any of those characters weren’t so polarizing, chances are you wouldn’t
even know who

they were.

Being polarizing is kind of scary sometimes. It is scary knowing that once
you start

sharing your opinions, there will probably be a group of people who
disagree with you and

will voice their opinions online. If you search for me online, you’re going to
find out there are people who love me and people who hate me. That’s just
the way it is. If you’re neutral, no one will hate you, but no one will know
who you are either. As soon as you start taking sides on important issues,
you’ll develop haters, but you’ll also develop a

group of raving fans. Those raving fans are the people who will buy your
products and services.

If nobody’s talking about you, then nobody knows who you are. It’s time to
step out

of that neutral space and start sharing your opinions. Bring the things you
care about into the open.

**IDENTITY OF AN ATTRACTIVE CHARACTER**

Your Attractive Character will typically take on one of the following types
of identities.

You get to pick which one you want to be, and once we go over the choices,
the right one

will probably jump out at you. When you get your identity together, it’s
going to shape how you communicate and interact with your audience.


**The Leader:** The identity of the leader is usually assumed by people whose
goal is to lead their audiences from one place to another. Most leaders have
a similar backstory to

that of their audiences and, therefore, know the hurdles and pitfalls the
audience members will likely face on the journey to get ultimate results.
Usually the desired result has already been achieved by the leader, and his
audience has come looking for help along that same path. I am sure that
there are leaders you follow in different aspects of your life, and this may
be the role that will be the most comfortable for you when communicating
with

your audience.

**The Adventurer or Crusader:** The adventurer is usually someone who is
very curious, but he doesn’t always have all of the answers. So he sets out
on a journey to discover the ultimate truth. He brings back treasures from
his journey and shares them with his audience. This identity is very similar
to the leader, but instead of leading his audience on a journey to find the
result, he is more likely to bring back the answers to give them.

**The Reporter or Evangelist:** This identity is often one that people use
when they have not yet blazed a trail to share with an audience, but have a
desire to. So they put on the hat of the reporter or evangelist and go out to
discover the truth. Typically, people who use this identity interview dozens,
hundreds, or even thousands of people and share those

interviews, and all they’ve learned along the way, with their audience.

This is the identity I used when I got started. I didn’t know a lot about
marketing online myself, so I started interviewing people. I became a
reporter, just like Larry King or Oprah. Because I started interviewing all
these cool people and sharing their stories and lessons, I started building an
audience of my own. People kept seeing me with these other

high-profile people, and over time, I became associated with them. My
status went up because I was constantly in the company of high-status


people. The knowledge and credibility I gained from being a reporter
naturally evolved into my coaching career.

Becoming a reporter is a great way to start a business in a niche you don’t
know much about.

**The Reluctant Hero:** This is my personal identity now, and typically the
one that I

try to share with my audiences. This is the humble hero who doesn’t really
want the spotlight or any fuss made over his discoveries. But he knows the
information or the secrets he has are so important that he must overcome his
shyness and share them with the

world. There’s a moral duty that compels him to share all he knows. Many
of you may feel

this way naturally. The spotlight is uncomfortable, but you know you need
to be there. If

that’s you, the reluctant hero is the perfect identity for you. Play the part.

Leader, adventurer, reporter, or reluctant hero: You probably identify
strongly with one of these four archetypes. Determine which type is a good
fit and build out your Attractive Character using the traits for that identity.
If you’re an adventurer, tell stories of adventure. If you’re a leader, tell
stories about where you’ve been and where you are going. If you’ve chosen
the right identity for you, it should be fairly easy to take on that role. If
you’re struggling to create your AC, perhaps you should take another look
at your identity.

**ATTRACTIVE CHARACTER STORYLINES**

Stories are a great way to communicate with your audience. And there are
six basic storylines that businesses use over and over again in emails, sales
letters, landing pages, and other communications. We use them because
they work. Each one is crafted for a specific purpose. Once you learn how


to utilize these storylines, you will see for yourself how powerful they are
and want to use them over and over in different ways. Let’s go over

the basic plot structure of each one.

**Loss and Redemption:** “I had everything. I was on top of the world. Life
was great.

Then ___________ happened. I had to figure my way out of
________________. But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise because I
went through __________, and I learned/received ___________. Now I
___________.”

Loss and redemption stories are very powerful because they show the
upside of going

through hardship or meeting challenges. If you have your own loss and
redemption story,

great! If not, you can always borrow one from one of your followers or
even from the mainstream media or a movie you like.

**Us vs. Them:** You want to use us vs. them stories to polarize your audience.

Remember the power of polarity? Using these types of stories will draw
your raving fans

even closer and give them a rallying cry against the outsiders. I often call
out the “talkers vs. the do-ers” on my list. I want people to make a choice
about who they are, because if

they’re with me, then they will be do-ers, continuing to ascend with me.

**Before and After:** “First I was ______________. Now I’m ___________.”

These are stories of transformation, and they work great in any market. For
example,


in the weight-loss market, you might say, “First I was fat. Then I tried
Program X. Now

I’m skinny.” Or, try this with the dating market: “First I was lonely and
unattractive. Then I got Program Y. Now, I’ve got chicks all over me.” Here
is a transformation for the making-money market: “First I was dirt poor,
living in a box under a bridge. Then I tried

Product Z. Now, I have a mansion in Beverly Hills.”

These stories are pretty self-explanatory and simple to write. In fact, you
can often tell the whole story with just pictures. But don’t let the simplicity
fool you. These stories are powerful motivators, and you should use them
often.

**Amazing Discovery:** “Oh my gosh, you guys ... wait til you hear about
this amazing

new thing I just discovered! You’re not going to believe it, but I hit it out of
the park on my first try! I wasn’t sure it would work, but it’s amazing.
You’ve got to try it!” These stories are huge for selling webinars and
teleseminars because they help people believe that the answer they have
been searching for is finally available to them.

**Secret Telling:** “I’ve got a secret ... if you want to find out what it is, you
need to do ___________.” This is my favorite type of storyline. My whole
company, DotComSecrets,

is built around “secret” storylines. The lure of secrets draws the reader into
your funnel and up your Value Ladder.

**Third-Person Testimonial:** Sharing other people’s successes with your
products and

programs provides powerful social proof. Get as many third-person
testimonials from your


customers, clients, and students as you can. Then sprinkle them liberally
throughout your

stories. Or use them as stand-alone stories and case studies.

**Let’s Review:** It’s time to get started creating your Attractive Character.
When I say

“create,” I don’t mean “make it up.” I mean to zero in on a story and
personality you or

one of your clients has. It’s real. Start assembling your identity, your stories,
your flaws, and your line in the sand. Most entrepreneurs never think about
this vital communication

tool. And even if they do, they don’t put in the time and effort to do a good
job creating a believable persona. Like I said before, creating your
Attractive Character can mean the difference between making one thousand
dollars a month and one hundred thousand.

**Up Next:** Now that you understand the strategy behind the Attractive
Character, let’s shift the focus back to how we can use this tool to
communicate with your audience and

help them to ascend your Value Ladder naturally.


## SECRET #7:

## THE SOAP OPERA SEQUENCE

When somebody joins your list for the first time, it’s essential that you
quickly build a bond between them and the Attractive Character. The way
you introduce your character can mean the difference between a subscriber
opening your emails consistently or hitting

the delete key. For years I tried dozens of ways to build a quick relationship
with people after they joined my list, but I always struggled until I learned a
concept called the Soap Opera Sequence from one of my friends, Andre
Chaperon.

If you’ve never watched a soap opera before, the stories rely on open-
ended, high-drama episodes that hook the viewers in and keep them coming
back every single day to

find out what happens next. The programs are continuous narratives that
never conclude.

The characters are always either getting into trouble or getting out of
trouble, falling in love or breaking up, heading to jail or escaping, dying or
magically re-appearing. If you


relate to the characters, you can’t help but get sucked into the drama and
want to know what’s coming next.

We’re going to use the same story structure and elements to create your
opening email

sequence. The goal is to create an instant bond between your Attractive
Character and the

person reading the email. If your first email is boring, you’re done. They
probably won’t

open the next one. But if you give them something interesting and hook
them with an open

storyline in the first email, then they will look forward to the next one, and
the next, and the next.

In your Soap Opera Sequence, you’re going to introduce your Attractive
Character and build up an open-ended dramatic story that draws the reader
in. There are a few different ways you can do this. For example, I’ve seen
sequences that Andre has built out

that have forty or fifty emails! I’ve never had the time or patience to be able
to do that, so instead I built out a simple, five-day Soap Opera Sequence
that I send out when someone

joins my list. The key to making this sequence work (just like a soap opera)
is you have to open and close loops that will drag your reader from one
email to the next.

For example, I may tell readers in the first email that I discovered the secret
to getting rid of their nerve pain forever without expensive pain medications
or side effects ... but

instead of telling them all the details, I merely open that loop and tell them
I’ll give them the secret tomorrow. Then, in the second email, I will give


them the secret, but then I open a new loop that pulls them into email
number three.

I’m sure you’ve seen directors do this on soap operas or reality shows. The
tactic pulls you from commercial break to commercial break, from episode
to episode. You see it

every day on TV; now it’s your turn to become a master at it with email.

Let me walk you through the five-email Soap Opera Sequence that readers
get when

they join my lists. It’s simple, and it works to build a relationship with the
Attractive Character fast. In this example, someone just joined my list by
filling out a form on a squeeze page requesting more information about
becoming an “Expert,” and the product

I’m going to be selling them in this series is called “Expert Secrets.”

**Email #1: Set the Stage.** This is the first email, a thank you note, that
people receive the minute they sign up for your list. It sets the stage for the
emails to come and lets people know what to expect. Are you going to
email them once a day, twice a day, or once

a week? For this first sequence, I recommend once a day for the best
results.

**Here’s an Example:**

Subject: [DCS] Ch. 1 of 5

Body: Hey, this is Russell, and I want to “officially” welcome you to my
world.

About ten years ago, I started my first online business while I was in
college

(selling potato gun DVDs), and this little hobby became my obsession.


I started selling all sorts of things online and have become a student of

marketing.

My other businesses are where I test and try stuff out...

DotComSecrets is where I share what I’ve learned.

My goal is always to give away better stuff for FREE than what other
people

charge for.

In fact, tomorrow I’m gonna do just that. Yes, I’m going to let you go
through

one of my BEST products for free—and then ONLY pay me if you think
it’s

worth it... BUT only if you open the email when it comes ...

Yes, you heard me right...

I want our relationship to start out great...

So, I’m going to WOW you with SO much value that you’ll feel obligated
to

buy stuff from me in the future (just kidding ... kinda).

Sound good?

Cool, then look for that email tomorrow.

Thanks,

Russell “Your New Marketing Buddy” Brunson


P.S. The subject line is “[DCS] Ch. 2 of 5: The day my education failed me”
—

so look for it!

**Email #2: Open with High Drama.** Okay, if you did a good job opening a
loop in email number one, then the reader will be anxiously waiting for
your next email to come

in. For me, this is where the story “selling” process begins. I learned from
Daegan Smith

that you ALWAYS start any good story at the point of high drama. Most
people mistakenly start their stories at the beginning, but usually stories
don’t get good until the middle, so it’s better to start at the good part, and
then you can go back and fill in the backstory after readers are hooked.

**Backstory.** Once you have their attention with emotional drama, you’re
going to go

back and tell them the backstory. Tell them the events that led up to the
high-drama moment. How in the world did you get yourself into such a
predicament? Typically, your

backstory is going to take you back to a similar spot the readers may be in
now. If you’re helping them to lose weight, you take them back to when
you were overweight. If you’re

teaching them finances, take them back to a time before you were
successful. You want to

bring them on a personal journey with you.

This backstory will lead up to a spot where you got stuck and hit a wall.
Usually this

is where the readers are in their lives right now. They are stuck, and that is
why they are open to your answers. You explain to them how you hit that


wall and then found the answer. But don’t give them the answer yet. Just
open the loop, and promise to close it in email number three.

**Here’s an Example:**

Subject: [DCS] Ch. 2 of 5: The day my education failed me.

Body: “How did I get here?”

I sat in the middle of a full auditorium, feeling a little confused that after
everything, it would all end here ... like this.

I had been blindly following the status quo for fifteen years, moving
towards

one goal, only to find out the whole thing was a lie ...

I looked to my left ... and I looked to my right ... and I saw hundreds of
others

in the same situation as me. Only THEY had smiles on their faces.

Didn’t they know what was about to happen to us?

It was Saturday, May 14th, 2005.

It was the day I was finally graduating from college, the day my parents had

told me about for years.

“You need to get a college education so you can get a good job.”

Sure, tonight there would be a lot of celebrating ...

But what about the next morning?

That’s when we all had a chance to meet the “Real World.”

And as we quickly found out, it’s not very nice or forgiving.


For most of the people who graduated with me, IF they were able to find
jobs,

they were going into entry-level jobs making thirty to forty thousand dollars
a

year...

Barely enough to cover the monthly payments for their student loans.

Loans which, by the way, are non-dismissible ... EVEN if you declare

bankruptcy.

The chains of debt and a job market that can’t pay enough to cover the costs

of our education is what we each inherited when we stepped into the “Real

World.”

So, when I looked around and saw them all smiling on graduation day, at
first

I was confused ...

Not for me, but for them ...

Because for me, I knew what my next step was. Just two years earlier, I had

stumbled on a cool way to take the things I was good at in my life and turn

those things into a business.

This was a business that had made me two hundred and fifty thousand

dollars my senior year in college and would go on to make me over a

**MILLION** dollars within just one year of graduation.


Would you like to know what **I** found out? Are you interested in how **I** was
able to get my idea up and running with literally no money, while **I** was
going

to school, wrestling, and spending time with my new wife?

If so, then look for my email tomorrow. I’m gonna show you the epiphany I

had, but more importantly, I’m going to explain how you can use it to get

similar results in your life!

So, look for tomorrow’s email. The subject line is [DCS] Ch. 3 of 5: Expert

Secrets.

Thanks,

Russell “Wish I Had My Tuition Back” Brunson

P.S. I almost forgot. I told you yesterday that I was going to GIVE you my
best

product for free ...

anything we’ve ever done in the past. So go signup for the training now and

let’s see where it could take you!

Talk to you tomorrow!


**Email #3: Epiphany.** Now it’s time to start bringing in the dawn. You have
an epiphany. You realize something you hadn’t thought of before. Maybe
it’s something that

was right in front of you the whole time. It’s the moment that everything
turned around for you. By now the reader is so hooked in, they want to
know (and hopefully buy) your solution. Most of the time, your epiphany
email will lead back to your core offer—

whatever you’re selling that solves the problem.

-

My epiphany was I needed to build a list, and that’s when I learned

about_________________.

-

I had to get a support system to help me get over my addiction; that’s when
I

found_________________.

-

I had to address the emotional roots of overeating, and that’s when I

discovered_________________.

The epiphany ties into the solution you’re selling. If you’re selling someone
else’s product, it’s enough to say your epiphany led to the discovery of the
product.

**Here’s an Example:**

Subject: [DCS] Ch. 3 of 5: Expert Secrets.

Body: I was sitting in my college classroom. doing the math and trying to


figure out howmuch my college professor was making per hour.

I assumed he was making about fifty thousand dollars per year. (My
estimate

may have been low or high; I have no idea.) If he was working forty-hour

weeks, then he was probably making about twenty-five dollars an hour.

I then looked at a “how to” book I had bought the night before. I had paid
fifty

dollars for the book, and I thought it was awesome.

I knew the person who wrote the book had said that he sells, on average,
one

hundred copies of that book per day. One hundred copies!

I was doing the math, and at fifty dollars per book, he was making about
five

thousand dollars per day! Or $1,825,000 per year!

But the craziest part is the guy only spent a few days writing the book (it
was

90% pictures and just 10% text), and when he was done, he NEVER had to

write it again. The book did the teaching for him! He was able to create it
once and then get paid for it over and over again!

That’s when I realized I didn’t want to sell my knowledge by the hour like
my

professor was doing ... I wanted to sell it like this author!

And so that’s what I did ...


And by my senior year in college, I had made about two hundred and fifty

thousand dollars!

And within a year of graduation, I had made over a million!

And I did this all by focusing on ONE thing ...

Selling my knowledge the right way!

Would you like to know how I did that?

If so, I just posted a video online that will show you how I took twenty
dollars

and a simple idea and turned it into a million-dollar-a-year “how-to”
business.

I posted the video here: [http://www.ExpertSecrets.com/freeaccess](http://www.ExpertSecrets.com/freeaccess)

Go check it out, and let me know what you think.

Thanks,

Russell Brunson

P.S. Tomorrow I want to show you a few hidden benefits that being an

“expert” will give you, benefits you probably don’t even know exist. Look
for

that email tomorrow!

**Email #4: Hidden Benefits.** In this email, you want to point out benefits
the reader is getting by knowing you and following your plan or by using
your product. You want to focus on benefits that probably aren’t as obvious.
This gives you another reason to email


them, and it gives the prospect another chance to build an even stronger
bond with the Attractive Character. This email will point out the hidden
benefits they may not have thought about before.

_Sure, you’re going to make more money—but you also get more freedom to
travel._

Sure, you’re going to lose weight—but you’ll also live long enough to
enjoy your grandchildren.

_Sure, you’re going to be able to work from home—but did you realize you’ll
be able to_

_take vacations whenever you want?_

Often, it’s the hidden benefits that really grab the reader and move them to
take action. So, you want to come up with parables (stories) that
demonstrate those hidden

benefits. Show them how you can take time off whenever you want, and
explain how that makes you feel. When the reader thinks, _Man, I want that
for myself!_ That’s when they click the link and buy your products.

**Here’s an Example:**

Subject: [DCS] Ch. **4** of 5: The Hidden Benefits.

Body: When I first became an “Expert”, I was concerned because I didn’t

have any credentials, degrees or anything...

I just knew that what I showed people worked and I wanted to share it.

But what caught me off-guard was how helping people get what they want
in

life actually changed the quality of my own life.


Sure, I started to make a lot of money, BUT... more importantly, each
person

I helped opened up new doors for me. Through my “Expert” business, I’ve

been able to travel around the world and meet cool people like Tony
Robbins

and Richard Branson...

But the REAL hidden benefit has been the fulfillment I get when I see

someone else change his or her life. And that is what this business really is

about for me, I’m guessing if you’re here, then it’s probably the same thing
for

you too—am I right?

If so, then you NEED to signup for my Expert Secrets course. Normally I

charge $3,000 to attend, but I am going to do two cool things for you:

I’m giving you a HUGE 90% discount

You’re ONLY gonna pay if you like it!

Yes, that’s right—you get to come signup, attend, get all of my best ideas—

and then IF (and only if) you love it, will you pay.

And if you don’t like it for any reason—then you’re getting it for free.

Does that sound more than fair?

Cool—then go get your ticket for our upcoming event (it’s happening this

Thursday) here:

**Email #5: Urgency and CTA.** This is usually the last email in my Soap
Opera Sequence. It’s NOT the last email I send people, it’s just the end of
my introduction. The goal is to give the reader one last push to go take
action right now. You do that by adding urgency into the equation and then
using a call to action (CTA). Up to now, you’ve been

casually using CTAs, but in this last email, you want to light a little fire
under readers.

What legitimate reasons can you come up with that would make them need
to take action

right away?

-

Your webinar starts tomorrow.

-

You only have ten seats left at your event.

-

You only ordered one thousand books, and most of them are gone.

-

You’re pulling the video offline.

Whatever the reason, it needs to be real. Fake urgency will backfire on you,
and you’ll lose all credibility. Just think of a reason why you might “run


out” of whatever you’re selling. If it’s an evergreen product, then create a
special sale that ends soon. Or give readers a coupon that expires in twenty-
four hours. Be creative! There’s always some

way to create real urgency.

**Here’s an Example:**

Subject: [DCS] Ch. 5 of 5: Last Call.

Body: I’ve been talking about my “Expert Secrets” class this week, and
how

you can get a ticket for free...

But that special offer is going away TODAY...

Yes, if you read this email tomorrow, then I apologize, because it will be too

late. If you take this class later, you’ll have to pay

AT LEAST $300, but I might put it back to its full ticket price of $3,000 by
then

as well (haven’t decided yet).

But—if you want to take me up on my “try before you buy” offer, and go

through the entire 51/4 hour training BEFORE you spend a dime...

Then go get your ticket ASAP here: [http://www.ExpertSecrets.com/freeaccess](http://www.ExpertSecrets.com/freeaccess)

You’ve been warned - I don’t want any emails tomorrow saying I didn’t
warn

you.

So, go get your ticket, and I’ll see you on the training.


Thanks,

Russell Brunson

**THAT’SHOW THE SOAP OPERA SEQUENCE WORKS:**

Email #1 pulls the reader to Email #2 ...

Email #2 pulls the reader to Email #3 ...

And so on.

The emails themselves should be easy to read and fast to scan. So, use one
or two sentences per line. Add in lots of white space. Do not use long
paragraphs that slow

people down. I like to write out the basic structure elements first. Then I fill
in the juicy details and emotional hooks.

You probably noticed a couple of other things in the example emails. First, I
use loads

of personality. This is the reader’s introduction to my Attractive Character; I
want people to bond with me and be entertained. I don’t try to hide who I
am. And along those same

lines, you may have noticed some grammatical errors. Why didn’t I fix
them? Remember,

your Attractive Character needs flaws so people can relate. That goes for
your emails, too.

I’m not telling you to put errors in on purpose, but if they happen, don’t
freak out. And please don’t let fear of making a mistake keep you from
sending out the emails at all.

If you follow the Soap Opera Sequence style, you’re going to be amazed by
how much more successful you are—early on and as long as you continue
to send emails to your list. To make it easy for you to get the hang of this,


I’ve created a special Soap Opera Email Template you can download and
use over and over again. By using this template,

you’ll never forget any of the major elements, and you’ll save a ton of time
when writing

emails.

**Up Next:** So, you’ve got your Soap Opera Sequence set up. Now what?
How should

your Attractive Character communicate with your list going forward?

I’m glad you asked! You’re going to use what I call Seinfeld emails. That’s
the next

secret!

## SECRET #8:


## DAILY SEINFELD SEQUENCE

_RUSSELL (an NBC executive): So, what have you two come up with?_

_JERRY: Well, we’ve thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic
idea is I will play myself._

_GEORGE: (Interrupting) May I?_

_JERRY: Go ahead._

_GEORGE: I think I can sum up the show for you with one word:
NOTHING._

_RUSSELL: Nothing?_

_GEORGE: (Smiling) Nothing._

_RUSSELL: (Unimpressed) What does that mean?_

_GEORGE: The show is about nothing. JERRY: (To George) Well, it’s not
about nothing._

_GEORGE: (To Jerry) No, it’s about nothing._

_JERRY: Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something. (Jerry
and George_

_glare at each other. The receptionist enters.)_

_SUSAN: What’s the premise?_

_JERRY: Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and as a comedian
living in New_

_York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true._


_GEORGE: Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it’s just like life.
You know, you eat; you go shopping; you read ... You eat; you read. You go
shopping._

_RUSSELL: You read? You read on the show?_

_JERRY: Well, I don’t know about the reading. We didn’t discuss the reading._

_RUSSELL: All right, tell me. Tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?_

_GEORGE: Oh, no. No stories._

_RUSSELL: No stories? So, what is it?_

_GEORGE: (Showing an example) What’d you do today?_

_RUSSELL: I got up and came to work._

_GEORGE: There’s a show. That’s a show._

_RUSSELL: (Confused) How is that a show?_

_JERRY: Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work._

_GEORGE: No, no, no. Nothing happens._

_JERRY: Well, something happens._

_RUSSELL: Well, why am I watching it?_

_GEORGE: Because it’s on TV._

_RUSSELL: (Threatening) Not yet._

_GEORGE: Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old
thing, then_

_maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my
artistic integrity._


_And I’ll tell you something else. This is the show, and we’re not going to
change it. (To Jerry) Right?_

Yes, that was the dialog from one of my all-time favorite TV shows,
_Seinfeld._ This was the episode when George and Jerry were trying to pitch
their idea to NBC about starting a show about nothing. It was funny
because the show _Seinfeld_ actually was a show about nothing.

When I first started growing my list, I really struggled to send emails. What
did I have

to say that was important enough that people would want to open and read
it? So I started

focusing on writing great, content-packed emails that often took days to
write. I thought

that was the answer. But I later discovered that after someone had gone
through my Soap

Opera Sequence and bonded with the Attractive Character, content wasn’t
what they responded to. What the readers responded to was ... well,
nothing.

My emails switched from 100% content to 90% entertainment and just 10%
content,

and my readership, opens, clicks, and sales all skyrocketed with the change.

You want your Attractive Character to be fun and entertaining. That’s how
you’re going to write your daily Seinfeld emails. That’s right; I recommend
sending them _daily_ after your initial Soap Opera Sequence is finished.

I know a LOT of people get VERY nervous about how often they email
their lists. I

used to feel that way, too. I used to email once a month, and my response
rates were horrible. So then I started emailing twice a month. And guess
what? I more than doubled


my income.

Then I decided to email once a week, then twice, then every other day, and
what I’ve

found now is that if I don’t email my list every day, I lose money every day.
I strongly recommend emailing every day, and if you do it with the
“Seinfeld style” I’m going to show you now, readers won’t get annoyed
because they will be so entertained.

The secret to keeping your subscribers happy to hear from you every day is
using the

Seinfeld format. Be entertaining. Just talk about your day.

-

What’s going on in your Attractive Character’s life?

-

What happened that’s embarrassing?

-

How are you getting through the holiday season?

-

Where are you planning your vacation this year?

-

What did you buy recently that you regret?

-

What did you buy recently that you just adore?


## •

What made you scream with rage yesterday, that you’re laughing about
today?

-

What crazy antics did your kid or your dog get into yesterday?

-

What funny thing happened in your past that teaches a lesson?

These are emails about nothing. Just random episodes and entertaining
stories.

EXCEPT ... they have a purpose. The goal is to lead people back to
whatever you’re

selling. It might be your core offer or some other product or service. It
might even be someone else’s product. Every story needs to relate back to
something you’re selling.

That’s the secret. That’s how you make money.

If you just send out entertaining emails and don’t tie in your products or
services, you

won’t make a dime. Not even if you’re the best storyteller in the world.
EVERY EMAIL

and each story must be tied back into some type of offer for your audience.

Let me show you an example of some Seinfeld emails and how I tie the
story back into the product I’m selling. Both these examples made over one
hundred thousand dollars

each when they were sent out to my list. They are both great examples of
emails about nothing.


## EXAMPLE #1

Subject: [True Story] He FLUSHED $20 million down the toilet today

Body: So, yesterday we had a guy apply for my Ignite program

I saw his app come through, and I was actually really excited, because he is

in the golf market.

Now, I’m no golfer, but I’ve got a lot of friends doing $20 million + in the
golf

market online.

I saw his product and KNEW it was a home run.

So, the coach who was going to call him back asked me for my opinion on
his

business before she called him, and I sat down for ten minutes and pulled
up

the following:

His three major competitors

Every site competitors were SUCCESSFULLY buying traffic from

The top three converting ads for each of his competitors

The sales funnels that WERE converting and the main reason his was NOT

I then showed her the two media buyers I would use if I were in the golf

market (both can send over one thousand sales a day, consistently).

Armed with this information, she called the guy up...


He was a little cocky (and rightfully so—he’d sold over 100,000 units of his

product on TV). Yet, for some reason, he couldn’t figure out this pesky

Internet thing ...

She started sharing some of my ideas with him, and then he stopped her...

_“Look, I’ve read twenty books on Internet marketing ... there isn’t a single
thing Russell could teach me that I don’t already know...”_

So she tried to explain, “Look ... you could read a million books on Jiu
Jitsu,

but that’s not gonna help you in a street fight...”

I thought that was pretty funny, but what happened next was just sad.

He said, “Well, Russell doesn’t know anything about golf...” and then he
hung

up.

Now, while he was right about me not knowing anything about golf...

I know EVERYTHING about SELLING golf stuff online.

I’ve been doing this for OVER ten years now. I’ve personally trained over

2,500 companies in my office here in Boise.

I’ve worked with a LOT of golf guys ... (and one golf gal).

I’ve worked with people in just about every market I can think of (except
bowling ... I’ve never had someone teaching bowling come to me, which

makes me sad, because bowling Is my third favorite sport after wrestling
and


Ju Jitsu).

Anyways ...

For about everything else I can think of, I’ve mapped out a funnel, shown
the

client what they were doing wrong, Introduced them to my media buyers,

advised them on which sites to buy ads from, and instructed them on what

they should be spending to acquire a customer in THEIR specific market.

I then usually introduce the client to the gurus I know in those areas. After
speaking on Dan Kennedy’s stage for six years, I have met most of the

“gurus” in most industries, and my position makes it easy to find
connections

for others.

Those are the things you CAN’T learn in a book ...

Those are the things we bring to the table for our Ignite people.

My goal for that group is not to teach them more stuff ... it’s to make them
more money.

Anyway, if you’ve got a golf product, let me know, because I’ve got a killer
twenty- million-dollar-a-year blueprint that this dude just flushed down the

toilet because of his arrogance ... or Ignorance. Either way, he lost out.

You can just plug in and run with it...

Or if you sell, well, almost anything else, I’d love to help with that, too.

Our next Inner Circle meeting is here in Boise in May. If you’d like to
come,


you’ve got to act fast.

You can apply here:

[http://lgnite.DotComSecrets.com](http://lgnite.DotComSecrets.com)

Oh, and we only accept cool people. If you like to flush money down the
toilet

... PLEASE don’t apply.

Thanks,

Russell Brunson

**EXAMPLE #2**

Subject: Jiu Jitsu is like wrestling for old, fat guys (and other marketing
stuff)

Body: So, tomorrow I’m fighting in a Jiu Jitsu tournament.

For those of you on my list who don’t know what Jiu Jitsu is, it’s kinda like
wrestling for old, fat guys (which is GREAT for me because, while I still
look

like I’m thirteen, I am actually getting a lot older—34 yrs old now—and
fatter


—30 lbs. heavier than when I was wrestling).

Anyway, I have weigh-ins in a few hours, and as of right now, **I’m still
seven**

**pounds overweight ...**

Good thing I’m a wrestler and have some awesome weight-cutting skillz. In

fact, I just found my old weight-cutting clothes this morning. Check them
out:

Yes, they are a little tight, but my three-year-old told me I look like a ninja,
so

they can’t be that bad ... right?

Anyway, in about an hour, I’m gonna go to the wrestling room, and within

thirty to forty minutes, I’ll lose all 7 lbs. Then tomorrow, I get to step onto a
mat with a bunch of younger, faster guys whose

ONLY goal in life is to choke me out ... (or to break my arm, whichever
comes

first).

I’m SO SO SO SO SO SO excited!

So, why do I tell you this?

Because this week, we did well over six figures in sales.

Not this month **... this WEEK.**

And we did it WITHOUT any product launches ...

WITHOUT any affiliates ...


And while that is a pretty normal week for us, this week was special
because

we also did it...

WITHOUT me actually being in the office ...

Yup...

You guessed it ... I spent most of this week in the wrestling room, getting

ready for the tournament this weekend.

Yet, we still did six figures in sales while I was gone.

Would you like to learn how I did it?

Would you like to see how you build a business that can run just as well
when you’re gone as when you’re there?

Are you ready to take your company to the next level?

If so, I’ve got good news for you ...

As long as I don’t end up in the hospital after my match this weekend, I’m

gonna be coming into the office next week.

That gives me time to work personally with two more people to help build
out

their funnels ... (the SAME type of funnel we use to pull in six figures a
week

like clockwork).

If you’re ready to take your game to the next level and create a business that


can truly give you time and freedom to do other things you love, then let’s
get

on the phone and figure out how we can work together.

Sound good? If so, then you can apply here:
[http://lgnite.DotComSecrets.com](http://lgnite.DotComSecrets.com)

Oh, and if you’re looking for a “get rich quick” scheme, this Isn’t it.

If you’re looking for a **“work hard and build an awesome company”**

scheme, then I’m your man!

Okay, I’m off to cut weight...

Wish me luck this weekend!

Thanks,

Russell Brunson

P.S. I already know that it’s not healthy to cut seven pounds in under an

hour... so no emailing me telling me it’s not healthy.

I’m pretty sure that stepping onto a mat with someone 30 lbs. heavier is a
lot

less healthy than me losing 7 lbs. of water in an hour. Haha...

**Do You See How Seinfeld Emails Work?** Do you see how the story
eventually ties

into a product?

That’s how your Attractive Character is going to communicate with your
list in every


email you send after your Soap Opera Sequence. It’s fun. And once you get
the hang of it,

the writing goes pretty fast. You can even dictate the email, record it on
your phone, and then send it to your assistant to be transcribed.

One thing I should note here. These are broadcast emails, not auto-
responders.

Soap Opera Sequence emails are set up to be an auto-responder sequence.
That means

after someone signs up, they get email one on the first day, then email two
on the next, etc.

Seinfeld emails are different. After someone has completed your SOAP
series, they should be moved to a broadcast list where they will only get the
Seinfeld email that you

send out that day. Seinfeld emails are typically not lined up in a sequence
that everyone

has to go through. That doesn’t mean you can’t write them ahead of time
and schedule the broadcasts in your email provider, but typically they are
tied to relevant things happening in the life of the Attractive Character as
they are happening.

Lastly, these emails do double duty when you put them on your blog.
People often ask

me what they should write about on their blogs, and I always tell them
simply to copy and

paste their daily Seinfeld email. It’s quick, easy, and consistent blog content
that leads people to a sale.

**Let’s Review:** Your Soap Opera (auto-responder) Sequence is your
Attractive Character’s introduction to your new subscriber. If you follow
the outline I provided, you’ll notice an increase in your sales simply


because people can relate to your backstory and epiphany after they read
about it.

Seinfeld emails continue the conversation on a daily basis. The goal is to be
fun and

entertaining while you sell stuff.

You can get started with this right now. Go download your Soap Opera
Sequence template, and write your first five emails.

Then start writing your Seinfeld emails and loading them into your email
provider. If

you get stuck for ideas, my team has compiled a list of writing prompts for
you. Download

them at [http://www.DotComSecretsBook.com/resources/seinfeld.](http://www.DotComSecretsBook.com/resources/seinfeld.)

**Up Next:** Now that you have seen how we communicate with the traffic
that we are

bringing into our funnels, it’s time to shift focus back to building your sales
funnel.

Section 3 is called Funnelology and will discuss the strategies behind
building your successful sales funnels.


PARTE 3


**FUNNELOLOGY LEADING YOUR CUSTOMERS TO**

**THE SALE (OVER AND OVER AGAIN)**


## SECRET #9:

## REVERSE ENGINEERING A SUCCESSFUL

## FUNNEL

Before I start to build out any new sales funnel, the first thing I want to do
is find other people who already have a successful funnel and are selling to
my target market. If I can’t find other businesses, then I won’t continue to
move forward. But if I _can_ find others who are already successfully selling
to the chosen market, then I can reverse engineer what they’re doing and
figure out where they are getting their traffic.

The Internet is full of gurus teaching hundreds of different ways to generate
traffic, and it seems like a new tactic or trick pops up every day. For me, I
focus on one real strategy. I prefer to find out where the traffic already
exists and then just plunk myself down in front of it and send it on a little
detour to my site. Why work hard to generate traffic when it’s already out
there waiting for you? This chapter is going to show you how to reverse
engineer your competitors’ sales funnels. You will learn how to understand
what they are doing, where their traffic is coming from, and how to
transform their traffic into _your_ traffic.

**FIVE VARIABLES OF SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGNS**


The first step to reverse engineering existing traffic streams is
understanding the five elements that go into any successful online ad
campaign. I never start creating a funnel

unless I know at least four of these five things. I never want two unknowns.
Also, as I’m analyzing my own funnels—if something isn’t working—it
usually comes down to one of

these five things:

1.

Demographics

2.

Offer

3.

Landing page

4.

Traffic source

5.

Ad copy

Let’s look at each variable individually so you can get a clearer picture of
what I’m

talking about.

**1. Demographics.** The demographics are all the characteristics of the
people you’re targeting. The demographics define who belongs in the target
group and who doesn’t.


We’re talking about distinguishing factors, like age, sex, education,
geographical location, income level, race, language, and political
affiliations—any and all characteristics you can think of that define those
people you want to reach with your message. For example, our

supplement company has an older demographic of men and women. Our
coaching

company’s main demographic is entrepreneurs making between one and
three million dollars a year.

If I put the right offer in front of the wrong demographic, it’s going to
bomb. If I put a wrestling supplement offer in front of older people with
diabetes, they’re not going to buy.

So, we need to make sure we get our demographics right. Once you know
the

demographics of the people your competitors are going after, it’s very
simple to know what yours should be.

When I first started working with our pain supplement, I had no idea who to
target or

where to find the traffic. So my team and I went through this process of
reverse engineering some supplements similar to ours, and we found out
very quickly where our

competitors were placing their ads. We found that some of their ads were on
diabetic websites (a segment we didn’t know would benefit from our
supplement). We found ads

running successfully on survival websites, natural health websites, and
more. By digging

deeper and researching our competitors, a whole new world of opportunity
opened for us.


After we found some of these new demographics, over the course of two
months, we were

easily able to scale a product that was making twenty thousand dollars a
month to making

over five hundred thousand a month now. Pretty cool, huh?

When you know your demographics, you know who your target market is
and where

they are likely to be hanging out online. You know what sites they’re on and
where they

get together to talk to each other. Once you have that information, it
becomes very easy to scale your offer and build your business quickly.

**2. Offer.** The offer comes down to what you are selling and at what price
point you are selling it, including your upsells and downsells. When I want
to find out what my successful competitors are offering, I buy their
products. Remember, the first offer you see

probably isn’t the primary offer. It’s more likely to be what gets people in
the door, while the real moneymakers are down the line somewhere. The
first offer is just the tip of the iceberg, and I need to see their ENTIRE
iceberg during this research phase.

When I’m researching competitors, I go in and purchase everything they
offer me. I

will easily spend hundreds of dollars to study their offers and their funnels.
And I keep careful notes. This is critical competitive research. I want to
know exactly what they’re selling, how they’re selling it, and at what point
they’re offering each product in their funnel. What’s the copy on the sales
videos? What emails am I getting? How many? Are

they selling in every email or offering content in some? The more I know,
the better chance of success I will have.


**3. Landing Page.** This is the page a person lands on right after they click
on an ad, and I believe it’s the most important page in your entire sales
funnel. What does that page look like for your successful competitors? Is it
an opt-in page? Is it a sales page? What’s working for people right now?
I’m not going to make up my own landing page and hope it

works. I’m going to reverse engineer what’s _already working_ and model
that for my own page. I’m going to make something very similar to what’s
already successful.

It always comes back to modeling what’s already working. It amazes me
how so

many people put up random sites they think look good, without first
investigating successful sites in their niche. Then they wonder why they’re
not making any money. It’s

because they’re not following a proven model.

I remember when I first heard Tony Robbins speak, and he emphasized that
if you want to be successful in any part of your life, you needed to find
someone else who is already doing what you want to do and model your
efforts after theirs. Nowhere is that idea truer than when you’re building a
new sales funnel. You need to model what is working. Do NOT try to re-
invent the wheel. That’s the secret. That’s how you take a decade of hard
work and compress it down into a day’s worth of time and effort. Find what
someone else has already done and model it. Start there, and then you can
tweak your funnel, test it, and try to improve on that model after you’re
already making money.

**4. Traffic Source.** Where is your competitor’s traffic coming from? What
are the specific websites that competitor buys ads on? Is the traffic coming
from banner ads or social media or email? Does he use mainly video or
text?

Do not think that you need to “create” traffic. The traffic is already out
there. All you


have to do is find it, tap into it, and redirect it back to your offer. In just a
minute, I’m going to show you some cool tools and techniques you can use
to find out exactly where a

competitor’s traffic is coming from so it’s easy to funnel those people to
your offers.

**5. Ad Copy.** This is the last element of a successful campaign. What do
successful ads look like? What makes people click on the ad? What’s
enticing them to even look at

the competitor’s ad in the first place? What pictures are competitors using?
What does the headline say? What does the body copy look like? Are the
competitors using video? All

these things influence whether a person clicks on an ad or not. Remember,
traffic is made

up of real people. People can be persuaded to click, but it can take months
or years of trial

and error to discover how to make that happen. Don’t waste time trying to
figure it out by blindly tweaking and adjusting your own advertising
methods. Find what’s already working, and model it. Then once you’ve got
a predictable, steady income, you can run split tests and try to improve on
the ad yourself.

The whole reverse engineering process depends upon finding out about all
five of these elements in regards to your competitors. Unfortunately, you’re
not always going to

be able to do that. I’ve gotten really good at the reverse engineering
process, but there are still times when I can’t find all the banner ads, or I’m
not sure about all the demographics.

One unknown is not good, but you can usually try to guess and get close
enough. If there


are two unknowns, I’m probably not going into that market. I want as much
data as possible before I start building out my offers, landing pages, and
ads. Never move forward with two unknowns. Keep digging, keep
researching until you find a niche where you can

find all the data you need to move ahead and be profitable.

**HOW TO REVERSE ENGINEER A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN**

Now that you know what to look for in your competitors’ campaigns, I’m
going to show

you how to dig up all this awesome information.

**Step #1: Where Are Your Competitors (Both Direct AND Indirect)?**
Right now, your customers are where your competitors’ customers are. So,
that’s where you need to

start looking. You have two types of competitors: direct and indirect. A
direct competitor is a person or company selling something very similar to
yours. In the supplement business, anyone else selling the same type of
supplements is my direct competitor. We are trying to sell basically the
same thing to the same people. We’re going to do a direct competitor
analysis in a moment.

There are also indirect competitors. These are people or companies selling
something

different than you, but to the same demographic. When I started studying
indirect competitors, it was a huge eye-opener for me. I remember one day I
found this cool supplement company selling weight-loss products to an
older demographic. They were an

indirect competitor because we were selling different products (weight-loss
supplements for them and nerve pain supplements for me), but we were
both going after the same demographic. I put their website into the tool I’m
about to show you, and it opened up a


whole new world of places to advertise and types of ads to try. Competitive
research is awesome because it can open up new opportunities you never
knew about before. For me,

each new profitable website I find can be worth tens, if not hundreds, of
thousands of dollars a month! So you can see why I spend so much time
searching for this buried gold.

The first step is to make a list of your direct and indirect competitors and
their landing page URLs. If you don’t know who your competitors are, then
just go to Google and start

typing in search phrases you would want people to type in if they were
searching for you.

If you’re in the weight-loss niche, for example, you’d just type in phrases
like “how to lose weight” or “losing weight quickly.” Look for the paid ads
(usually on the right hand

side) and start clicking on those ads. This will give you a good idea of who
your


successful competitors are. Now that you have your competitors’ website
URLs, let me show you how simple it is to find out exactly WHERE they
are already advertising, WHAT ads they’re running, and WHERE they are
sending their traffic. Using this simple

strategy, you’ll quickly be able to figure out all five of the variables in each
of the competitors’ campaigns.

**Step #2: What Are They Doing?** There are a few products on the market
that will do

what I’m about to show you. At the time of my writing this book, my
favorite is called

SimilarWeb.com (SW). Because I want this book to stay evergreen, I will
post a video showing you how to use SW here:
[http://www.DotComSecretsBook.com/resources/similarweb,](http://www.DotComSecretsBook.com/resources/similarweb,) and if my team ever
finds software we like better, or if SW stops working, we’ll give you


the most up-to-date information on that page.

So, the first step is to put in your competitor’s website URL. For this
example, I will

enter one of my own websites for you to see.

Fig 9.2: It’s easy to find your competitors’ traffic sources with online tools
like

Similar Web.

From here, I can quickly see each of the paid traffic sources that the
competitor is using.

As I start clicking on some of the other options on the side of the page, I
can see the

demographics of the traffic that is coming to that website. I can dig deeper
into the traffic sources and actually see what sites my ads are running on,
when they were first seen, and

the duration each ad has been running. (Hint: longer duration=ad that is
working.)


Fig 9.3: Long running ads are usually high-converting and big money
makers.

As I dig deeper, I can start to see the exact banner ads that are working,
including the

ad copy that is converting.


Fig 9.4: Collect the actual ads your competitors are running and model them
for

your own ads.

I can also see the landing pages the competitor is pushing the majority of
traffic to and a whole bunch more. Do you see how in less than five minutes
I can learn EVERYTHING I need to know about a competitor’s campaign?
I’ve just shown you how

quickly you can grab the five variables we need to be successful:

1.

Demographics

2.

Offer

3.

Landing page

4.

Traffic source

5.

Ad copy

The last step is actually to purchase my competitor’s product so that I can
see the upsells and downsells. What email does this company send to
customers? What else happens after the initial purchase? Armed with this
information, you now have everything

you need to start building out your own successful sales funnels in that
niche.


Isn’t it amazing? You can literally reverse engineer everything your
competitor is doing in less than ten minutes. Just plug in the website and go
where they have already gone. Sell to the customers who have already
shown interest in this type of product or service. Redirect them to buy your
products!

**LET’SREVIEW:**

1.

Make a list of your direct and indirect competitors.

2.

Find each landing page URL.

3.

Enter a URL into the online research tools.

4.

Collect data, dig deep, click on links, buy products, and see what the
competitor

is doing.

5.

Create a swipe file of ideas to model.

To help you out, I’ve created a checklist you can download and keep handy
while you’re researching. With this checklist, you’ll be sure not to miss any
critical components of

your

**Up Next:** Now that you’ve had a chance to look at what your competitors’
sales funnels look like, I want to walk you through the seven phases of all
successful sales funnels. This will give you a very clear example of each of
the phases that your customers should go through as they ascend your Value
Ladder.

## SECRET #10:

## SEVEN PHASES OF A FUNNEL

What’s the difference between a six-figure, seven-figure, and eight-figure
business? When


I first started to scale my companies, I thought there must be huge
differences between each of these levels, but that’s not the case. After going
through these levels over the past decade or so, I can tell you the main
difference is not what you might think.

-

It’s not the products you sell.

-

It’s not the type of business you run—online or local brick and mortar.

-

It’s not the traffic.

-

It’s not the sales copy.

-

It’s not a high-converting website.

-

It’s not a product-launch method.

These things are all important. They’re all elements of a successful
business. But they

are not the core difference that sets the levels apart.

**The real difference between having a six-, seven-, or even eight-figure
business is**

**whether you understand the phases of a funnel and can successfully
monetize the different points along the line.**


When I’m driving traffic to a website, I need to know the first page the
potential customer will hit. I need to know the second page he hits and
everything he will experience while he’s engaged with my business. I need
to carefully engineer the process

(or funnel) each customer goes through. And different types of people
require different treatment (and different processes).

Lots of people talk about the lifetime value of a customer, but that’s not
what I’m talking about here. I’m talking about the path that you take your
customers down. I’m zeroing in on the variables in each step that can be
manipulated for maximum


monetization—all while keeping a relationship so that the customer will
continue to ascend your Value Ladder. A person might be with me for a few
minutes, a few hours, or

dozens of years. The money you make in your business depends on how
well you manage

the experience of every person who comes in contact with you—no matter
how long they

stay.

Your goal, of course, is to get the prospect to stick around and become a
regular client

or repeat buyer. The longer you can keep them around, the more likely
they’ll buy from

you. The way you keep them around is by managing the experience
throughout the process. I’ve broken the customer experience down to seven
specific points in the funnel.

At each point, you can test, tweak, monetize, and build your business to
whatever level you want. Once you know these seven points and how to
maximize them, your life will change. It’s awesome!

**IT’SALL ABOUT THE PRE-FRAME**

Before we talk about the seven phases of a funnel, you need to understand
the concept of a pre-frame because each step in a funnel is a pre-frame for
the next step. That is why it’s essential to optimize these steps—not only for
monetization, but also to build relationships and get visitors to continue to
buy from you, someone they know and trust. One big mistake many
marketers make is focusing 100% on short-term conversions or

monetization. They sell so aggressively, focused on the sale at hand, that
they lose the respect of their customer. This mistake will cost you the long-


term relationship that can be worth ten times as much as the money made
through the initial point of contact.

Experts in neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) talk a lot about pre-framing
to gain the outcome you desire. A pre-frame is simply the state of mind you
place someone in as

they enter into the next step in your sales funnel. Changing the frame of
mind, the mindset, can profoundly change the answer to a question or the
experience you have with

someone or something.

People do this all the time without realizing it. For example, if I want to ask
my wife a

favor, I might pre-frame her by saying, “Wow, you are looking beautiful
today. Thanks so

much for all the great stuff you’re doing with the kids tonight. I really
appreciate you spending the evening with them.” Then I might follow that
up with, “I’m just curious, do

you mind if I go hang out with my buddies tonight?” Because I started with
the pre-frame,

it’s more likely that she’ll respond the way I want her to. I set up a positive
frame of mind before I asked the favor.

My first Internet marketing mentor was a guy named Mark Joyner. I
remember him

saying that not all clicks are created equal. That struck me as odd because
business owners always talk about traffic and how to get more clicks to
their websites—not a certain kind

of click. Wasn’t a click just a click? But Mark made me understand that
what really


matters most is where those clicks are coming from and what that reader
experienced before he got to your site. He even went so far as to say that the
frame people enter your website through is probably the most important
thing you can know.

He used me as an example: “Consider a person came from a website that
said,

‘Russell Brunson is a scam artist. He stole my money. He’s unethical. He’s
a liar, and I don’t trust him. Click here to see his new product.’ What do you
think will happen when

he clicks through to see the product?” The pre-frame was terrible. That
visitor is probably not going to like me, and I will have a hard time getting
them to buy anything.

On the other hand, what if the person comes from a site that says, “Russell
is an amazing person. I had a chance to meet him; we talked for an hour,
and what he taught me

changed my business and my life. My company was able to go from
nothing to a million

dollars of revenue a year. Click here to see his new product”? The chances
of converting

that potential customer on my site are much, much higher. I can sell more if
the visitor enters my website through a good pre-frame. The frame through
which he entered my website completely changes what can happen on the
actual page. So the trick is to figure

out how to control the frame that your traffic is coming through.

In the book _Sway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior,_ by Ori and
Rom Brafman, I read about a fascinating study that took place at MIT,
demonstrating the pre-frame principle in action. It went something like this:
One day, a class of seventy economics students were told they would have a
substitute professor for the day. Since this professor was new, each student


was to read a short biography of the teacher. The bios handed out to all the
students were identical—except for one phrase. It praised this teacher’s
graduate work in economics and listed various fabulous accomplishments.
Then

half the bios described the professor as “a very warm person,” while the
other half described him as “rather cold.” That was the only difference—
one phrase.

After the lecture, each student was asked to fill out a survey to see how they
liked the

teacher. The ones who received the “warm” bio said they loved him. They
said he was good natured, considerate of others, and sociable. The students
who received the “cold”

bio didn’t like him at all. They said he was self-centered, formal, irritable,
and ruthless.

These students all sat through the same lecture, but the pre-frame changed
their perception of what they witnessed. This study is such a cool example
of the pre-frame principle at work.

**How to Pre-Frame Your Presentations for Higher Sales:** The first time I
witnessed

this concept in action was back when I first started speaking at events on
Internet marketing. Event coordinators would invite me to speak, and
afterward I was allowed to

sell my product at the back of the room. Obviously, I wanted to make lots of
sales, so I tried to craft my presentation in a way that would deliver such
great value that people would want to buy a coaching package from me at
the end. I travelled around the country,

speaking once or twice a month. Often I would test different pitches to see
which method


people responded to most.

I remember one event that had a profound effect on me. I was working with
a big event promoter named Armand Morin, who had done tons of events
all around the world.

He was also one of the best stage presenters around at the time. I remember
he pulled me aside and said there was one deciding factor that would affect
how much money I made at

the event. “It’s all about how I introduce you,” he said.

He asked me to look back at the last ten or fifteen events I worked and
remember the

events where I did really, really well in sales. Then he said, “Remember
back to how the

person introduced you before you got on stage. Most promoters do a
horrible job. They get

up there and say something like, ‘Hey, this is Russell. He is great, and he’s
going to teach you this cool thing. Everyone give him a round of
applause.’” When that happens, sales

are kind of flat. But this promoter crafted my introduction in a way to pre-
sell my credibility as a speaker and get the audience prepared to buy. He
had some of the most successful events because of this simple strategy.

I thought his suggestion was really interesting. When I spoke next at his
event, I sold

more product by far than at any other seminar. Going forward, I paid
attention to what happened when promoters introduced me. Sure enough,
there would be a drop of energy

in the room if the introduction was bland and uninspiring. Everything was
different, and it affected my sales. Finally, I decided to be in charge of the
pre-frame. I didn’t want to run the risk of the promoter screwing it up. So, I


made a three-minute introduction video. It featured Tony Robbins
recommending me, outlined several success stories, and included

the testimony of others who declared I was a great guy with a lot to offer.
Before I went on stage, I had the promoter introduce the video. The video
played, and then I came up on stage right afterward. The video was the pre-
frame, and because I now controlled the frame, I started seeing consistently
higher sales almost every time I spoke. Pretty cool, huh? If you speak and
sell after each event, give this strategy a try. You’ll thank me for it.

Now that you understand pre-framing, you’re going to love how powerful
the seven

phases of a funnel truly are.

**HOW PRE-FRAMING WORKS**

Many online marketing and conversion trainings start teaching conversion
on the landing

page. They show you how to split test different designs and how to tweak
your offers and

your funnels. But I’ve found there are three critical steps _before_ the visitor
even gets to the landing page that have a huge effect on your conversions.
There are also several steps in

the funnel that happen _after_ someone leaves your landing page. These also
have an enormous impact on your conversions and your bottom line. If you
understand all seven

points in the funnel, your business will likely explode without any
additional traffic or tweaking. So, let’s go through the phases one at a time.

**Phase #1: Determine Traffic Temperature**

The first phase to examine is the mindset of the traffic before it reaches
your site—or, your traffic temperature. You may not ever think about it, but


there are three levels of traffic that come to your website: hot, warm, and
cold. Each group needs special treatment and

individualized communication. Each needs to come across a different
bridge to arrive at your landing page. Yes, that means you may even need
three different landing pages, depending on how you’re driving traffic.
Trust me, it’s worth taking the extra time to set this up correctly.

Here is a quote from Gene Schwartz that helped me to understand hot vs.
warm and

cold traffic and how you must communicate differently with each type:

_If your prospect is aware of your product and has realized it can satisfy his
desire, your headline starts with the product. If he is not aware of your
product,_

_but only of the desire itself, your headline starts with the desire. If he is not
yet_

_aware of what he really seeks, but is concerned with the general problem,
your_

_headline starts with the problem and crystallizes it into a specific need._

Fig 10.2: Start your copy wherever your prospect is at the time.

You have to figure out where your prospect is along the product-awareness

continuum: product aware, desire aware, or problem aware. Where they are
determines the


temperature of the traffic. If you have cold traffic, they will probably be
aware of the problem they are having, but may not be aware of the solution.
For these people, you need

to focus your copy on the problem because that’s what they’re most aware
of. Traffic from

your blog may be aware of the solution because you presented it in the blog
post. So for

these people, you want to focus on the solution. Hot traffic from your email
list probably knows you and your product, so they would be the most
product aware and would respond

best to product-based copy.

**Hot Traffic** is made up of people who already know who you are. They’re
on your email list, they subscribe to your podcast, they read your blog—you
have an established

relationship with them. You’re going to talk to these people like they’re
your friends (because they are). You want to use personality-driven
communication. Tell them stories,

share your opinions, and let them into your private life a little bit.
Remember the Seinfeld email examples from the last chapter? They each
brought me over one hundred thousand

dollars because I had hot traffic, and I knew how to talk to them.

**Warm Traffic** consists of people who don’t know you, but they have a
relationship with somebody you know. This is where joint venture (JV)
partnerships work well.

Affiliates or JV partners have relationships with their lists, and they endorse
you or your offer to their subscribers. They lend their credibility to you so
their followers feel comfortable checking out your offers.


Direct mail companies have used this pre-framing technique for decades.
Different companies have their own house lists, and sometimes one
company would mail out a sales

letter for someone else’s product. Just like joint ventures today, the
companies usually split

the profit 50/50. To achieve a positive pre-frame, the company that owned
the list would add what’s called a “lift letter.” This was just a personal note
saying something like, “Hey, I like this product. I endorse it. This company
is great; you won’t be sorry if you order from them.” Lift letters increased
(“lifted”) response dramatically because the person reading it had some sort
of relationship with the writer or the company giving the recommendation.
One good pre-frame can make a page convert like crazy, but when you

try to drive cold traffic to it, it bombs.

**Cold Traffic** is made up of people who have no idea who you are. They
don’t know

what you offer or whether they can trust you. These may be people you find
on Facebook

or who click on your pay-per-click ads. Maybe they stumble across your
blog somehow.

Most likely, you’re paying for this traffic somehow, so it’s important to pre-
frame them correctly to get the highest return on your investment.

The first step is to figure out what temperature your traffic is so that you
can build the right pre-frame bridge.

**Phase #2: Set Up the Pre-Frame Bridge**

The second phase is your pre-frame bridge. This might be a pay-per-click
ad or it might be an article in an email or a blog post. It might be a YouTube
video. It’s a bridge that pre-frames people before they get to your landing
page. Different types of traffic need different bridges.


**A Hot Traffic Bridge** is typically very short. You already have a
relationship with these people, so you don’t have to do a lot of credibility
building or pre-framing. You can probably just send out a quick email with
a link to your landing page, and that’s about it.

Or maybe you write a blog post or record a podcast encouraging people to
go check out

your offer. These people will listen and do as you suggest simply because
they already know, like, and trust you.

**A Warm Traffic Bridge** is a little longer than a hot traffic bridge, but not
much. All that traffic needs is a little note of endorsement from a person
they trust; then they’ll be in the right frame of mind to go to the landing
page. This is where the lift letter or personal email from a JV partner comes
in. This bridge could be an email, but it could also be a video, article, or
some other communication from the list owner, endorsing you and your

product.

**A Cold Traffic Bridge** is the holy grail of online marketing. If you really
want to scale your business, you have to learn how to convert cold traffic.
Most people I know just can’t do this. They can convert like crazy with
their own list or a partner’s list. But when it comes to converting a cold list,
they’re stuck. They just can’t make it work. If you learn this one skill—
converting cold traffic—you’ll know the secret behind growing seven-,
eight-, or even nine-figure businesses. This bridge is the longest. You need
to do a good

bit of preliminary work to get the prospect into a desirable frame of mind
_before_ he hits your landing page. Let me explain.

Let’s say you’re at the food court in the mall, and you walk up to people
waiting in line at Panda Express and say, “Hi there. I’m selling this product
that teaches you how to build a list and drive traffic to it. It’s great! Would
you be interested in buying it?” What do you think they’re going to say?
First of all, they don’t know you, so the chances of them saying yes are
pretty slim. But in addition to that, you’re talking in a language they may


not even understand. Do these strangers know what a list is? How about
traffic? They

might think you’re talking about highway traffic. This is a huge mistake,
and I see businesses make this misstep online all the time. They talk to cold
traffic in the wrong language, and nobody buys. To fix this, you need to
make your offer more general. Talk in

terms that cold traffic will understand.

For example, I have a membership site called ListHacking. It teaches
people how to

make money by building a list and driving traffic. For our cold traffic, I
knew we couldn’t talk in terms of “traffic” and “lists” right off the bat.
First, we had to explain those concepts so the reader would know what we
were talking about. My team developed a different funnel for cold traffic
that started out saying, “Who wants a free money-making

website?” Once they got the free website, we sent them to a bridge page
that said, “Thanks for requesting your website; you’ll be receiving it
shortly. While we have your attention, do you know how to get people to
visit your website?” (Notice I said _people,_ not _traffic.)_ Then the page goes
on to explain that in online sales, potential customers are “traffic.” We
further explain that in order for them to make money on this new, free
website, they must

learn how to get traffic to the site. We continue explaining the topic of
traffic and lists on the bridge page. Now, when the “cold” visitor does cross
over to the membership site offer, they are perfectly pre-framed to
understand the offer. That understanding makes them more likely to
convert. I bridged the knowledge gap using a pre-frame.

For hot and warm traffic, the ad or email generally serves as the pre-frame.
There’s no

need for extra steps before those people understand your offer. They already
know, like, and trust you. But for cold traffic, you often need a whole


separate page that they go through (the bridge page) before they hit the
offer page. As I just explained, this separate, pre-frame page educates
people, enabling them to better appreciate the offer and making

them more likely to convert.

Here’s another example from my supplement company. One of the products
we sell is

a supplement to help with neuropathy pain. If I have a list of neuropathy
sufferers, it’s pretty easy to convert them. But what if someone on my list
doesn’t have neuropathy as a

common characteristic, or doesn’t _know_ whether they have it? Many people
know they have nerve pain, but have never heard the word _neuropathy._ So
our cold traffic offer helps people with _nerve pain,_ a simpler, more relatable
term. My pre-frame page states, “If you have nerve pain, it’s probably
caused by neuropathy.” Then the page goes on to explain a

bit about the unfamiliar term. Then, when the visitor gets to the funnel’s
landing page, all the language suddenly makes sense. They now understand
that the nerve pain is due to neuropathy, and our supplement can help. What
happens when we do that? Our universe

of potential customers expands exponentially! Whatever product you’re
selling, it’s critical that you match your message to your traffic’s
temperature and knowledge. This awareness will help you determine the
kind of bridge required to take them to the landing

page.

Blogs are another great way to pre-frame an offer. Often we’ll contact
someone who’s

gone through our business program and been successful. We’ll sometimes
pay them to write a blog post, testifying to the incredible experience. They
can then post this praise on their blog. Next, we drive traffic to that blog
post so readers see the recommendation and then click over to our product.


Because the traffic is coming from the pre-frame of somebody else’s site,
we dramatically increase our conversions. We are now tapping into

the group of people who know and trust the blogger.

We can do the same thing with YouTube testimonials. If someone puts up
their own

video about one of our products, we’ll ask them to add some keywords to
the description

and add a link back to our product’s site. Then we drive traffic to the
YouTube video that shares the story. Now the traffic comes to our site with
a better chance of converting. Our conversion numbers in these scenarios
are crazy high simply because of the positive pre-frame.

Another cool type of bridge page is a survey or a quiz. We can ask certain
questions

to get the mind’s wheels spinning in a particular direction. We plant seeds,
and the visitors start wondering about a question we asked. Then they click
over to the landing page where

we reveal the answer or solution. It’s all about influencing what people are
thinking about when they see your offer.

**Phase #3: Qualify Subscribers**

The whole goal here is to take all the traffic—hot, warm, and cold— and
find out who is

willing to give us an email address in exchange for more information. (This
is known as

subscribing to a list.) If people aren’t willing to give their email addresses at
this point, they are highly unlikely to give me money later. Qualifying
subscribers is done through an opt-in or squeeze page that offers something
of value in return for contact information.


This is typically the very frontend of your Value Ladder. For my companies,
it’s usually a free report or a free video showing the visitor one thing they
would really want to know.

Let’s say I have one thousand visitors who come to my site each day. If I
have a 30%

conversion rate at this point, then I know I have about three hundred people
who will be

interested in my information. Now I have a list of warm leads, and I can
continue to move

them through the rest of my funnel.

**Phase #4: Qualify Buyers**

Immediately after you qualify your subscribers, you want to find out who
among them is a

buyer. How many of those three hundred people who were interested in
getting free information are willing to pull out their credit cards and make a
purchase? Notice I said

you must find your potential buyers _immediately_ after you qualify
subscribers. Don’t wait a day or a week. Qualify buyers right away. My
early mentor Dan Kennedy taught me this

golden principle: _a buyer is a buyer is a buyer._ If someone is willing to buy
from you

once, they’ll continue to buy from you as long as you keep offering value.
So as soon as someone fills out their name and email address and clicks the
submit button, they should

land on a page that offers something to buy. Offer them something of value
that will hook


them. It’s typically a little higher up your Value Ladder, and this is where
I’m usually selling my “bait,” which is something your dream clients will
really love. It should be priced so low that it’s an absolute no-brainer for
them to buy. You want to qualify every

buyer on the list, so don’t put up any barriers.

I usually use a “free-plus-shipping” offer or something in the five to seven
dollar range. The offer is extremely cheap because I want all the buyers to
go for it. Once I’ve

identified who the buyers are, then I can market to them differently. I can
pick up the phone and talk to them; I can send them a postcard or add them
to a separate email sequence. At this point, I have two lists: subscribers and
buyers. Each list is unique and gets treated differently.

**Phase #5: Identify Hyperactive Buyers**

After you’ve identified the buyers, you want to identify the _hyperactive_
buyers. These are the people who are in some kind of pain right now and
will buy more than one thing at a

time. I’m often a hyperactive buyer myself. I remember taking my team
bowling for a company party a while back. Now, bowling happens to be my
third favorite sport (behind

wrestling and jiu-jitsu). I’m not a superstar bowler, but I can hold my own. I
love playing the game. That particular day, I brought my own ball, gloves,
and shoes. I’ll admit I kind of wanted to show off in front of my employees.
Well, that day one of the other guys had

the magic touch. He bowled an awesome couple of games, and he just plain
beat me. He

was razzing me in front of all my team, and I remember feeling so
frustrated. I can laugh


at it now, but at the time, I really didn’t like it. So I went home and got
online and started buying bowling stuff—books, videos, a new ball—
anything that would alleviate my

humiliating defeat. I was a hyperactive buyer!

You want to identify these people as quickly as possible. Who’s in pain
right now?

And what are they willing to buy _right now_ to alleviate that pain? You want
to be able to offer them something—ideally several somethings. If you
don’t, they’ll leave your site and go find another site to buy from. People
love to buy. And when they’re in pain and want

relief, they will spend money in that quest. I forgot about bowling a few
days later, and life continued on. I was no longer a hyperactive buyer of
bowling merchandise. The window closed. So think about what you can
upsell or downsell after your initial offer. If you’ve bought any of my
products, you know I always have a chain of upsells and downsells. That’s
because I want to identify my hyperactive buyers. Once I know who they
are, I’m going to treat them differently, too.

**Phase #6: Age and Ascend the Relationship**

At this point, the initial sales experience is pretty much over. Points one
through five all

happen in five or ten minutes, and the next two points explain what keeps
those people you’ve identified coming back to buy from you again and
again. These next steps are what

keeps them referring you to friends. During this step, you want to age and
ascend the relationship. Remember your Value Ladder? This is where that
ladder of products and services really becomes important. If you’ve
followed the five phases of the funnel up to

here, you’ve already moved people through the first level or two (or three)
on your Value


Ladder. Now, you’re going to continue to provide value and help people
with whatever you offer. Allow some time to pass. How much time is up to
you; whatever feels logical

for your product is best. Let them dig into whatever products they’ve
already purchased,

and give them enough time to see the value you give. You’re going to
ascend them up the

ladder over a longer period of time, eventually moving them to the very top
level.

This is the point where we start changing the types of funnels we use. If we
started

with a Free-Plus-Shipping Funnel, we may move the buyer into an Invisible
Funnel or maybe bump them up to a Two-Step, High-Ticket Backend
Program. (Don’t worry; you’re

going to learn how to build these different funnels in the second half of this
book.)

**Phase #7: Change the Selling Environment**

Typically, it’s difficult to sell super-expensive products or services online.
Not many people are going to read a sales letter and click the buy button for
a fifteen thousand dollar product. Some might, but usually you have to
change the selling environment if you want

to sell high-ticket products. The most common ways to change the
environment are to sell

the pricier items over the phone, through direct mail, or at a live event or
seminar. If I send an email out to you and ask you to click an eight thousand
dollar buy button, you’re probably not going to do it. But if I can get you to
click a button and schedule an appointment to chat on the phone, suddenly I


have a completely different sales environment. People on the phone are
more likely to listen closely to an offer. The sales

person has the benefit of live feedback. He or she can overcome objections
and help people make up their minds on the fly. When we change the
selling environment, we can

communicate at a different level, and it becomes easier to move people up
to the higher

levels of the Value Ladder.

**Let’s Review:** If I were to consult with a retail store on how to increase
sales, I would look at everything that happens during a customer’s
experience with the store, including

the moment a customer saw the ad, walked in the front door, and received a
greeting from

the employees. I would analyze what the customer saw that made them
choose certain items, what products were “point of sale,” and how the
cashier upsold them during checkout. I would then analyze the follow-up
sequences already in place to bring that customer back.

Increasing online sales happens the same way. You need to break out and
examine each of the phases your customer passes through in your sales
funnels. After you are aware of the distinct steps and break each out into a
separate experience, you can then tweak each aspect to get more
conversions. In this way, you can help people ascend to the

next level of your Value Ladder. If you’re stuck in your business, it’s
probably because there’s a glitch in one of these seven steps. What’s the
temperature of the traffic you’re driving? What’s the pre-frame bridge
you’re taking potential buyers through? On the landing page, are you
qualifying subscribers? Are you qualifying your buyers on the sales

page, and your hyperactives on the upsell pages? Are you aging and
ascending the relationship to match the buyer with the offer they really need


the most? And are you changing the selling environment for your high-
ticket offers? Most importantly, how are you treating each of your different
groups so that each receives a specially tailored experience?

**Up Next:** Now that you understand the strategy behind the seven phases of
a sales funnel, I want to show you what types of web pages we use for four
of those phases. Did

you like to play with Lego blocks when you were a kid? I did. It was so
cool to take the

same, simple pieces and create something totally unique, over and over
again. In the upcoming chapters, you’re going to learn how to build sales
funnels Lego-style. In fact, I’m going to give you a list of building blocks
that you can simply mix and match to build your offer to create an instant
sales funnel. Then I’m going to give you some short cuts—

the exact funnels and scripts I use most often in my businesses. You can
copy and paste

your own offers and ideas into these proven templates and have your
business up and running in no time.


## SECRET #11:

## THE TWENTY-THREE BUILDING BLOCKS OF

## A FUNNEL

As I said, I think of sales and building funnels kind of like playing with
Legos. I imagine there’s this big box of brightly colored building blocks,
and I can put them together any

way I want to get the desired results. If I want to get someone to opt-in to
my list, I might use a yellow block and connect it to a blue block. If I want
to make a high-ticket sale, I might add on green, red, and purple blocks. If
I’m not getting the results I want, but I know I have all the right pieces, I
might rearrange the blocks and see what happens.

This is the exact same process I teach my twenty-five-thousand-dollar
clients. I go through each phase of the funnel and map out which building
blocks will yield the best results. Then we test the funnels to see how well
they convert. Sometimes we hit a winner

right away, but often we need to move the blocks around a bit; for example,
we might change some copy or add a video. Then we test the combination
again. This is how direct

response marketers have created magic for over a hundred years: Try it.
Test it. Tweak it.

And start all over again.

There are two types of Lego sets. You can buy all the blocks and create
your own work of art using your imagination. Or you can buy special kits
that give you the pieces

you need to build specific things, like the Death Star or the Bat Cave. These
kits even give

you instructions on which piece to attach where and in what order. If you’re
the kind of person who loves the Lego kits, you’re going to love our funnel-


building software called

ClickFunnels. All the pieces you need are inside the software, easily
enabling you to create all sorts of funnels to sell everything from a simple
opt-in to a high-end consulting package. And all you have to do is pick
which cool thing you want to build and click a button. All the pieces are
automatically arranged in the right order for you. If you’d like to try it out,
you can get a free two-week trial at [http://www.ClickFunnels.com.](http://www.ClickFunnels.com.)

This chapter is going to show you twenty-three of the most effective
building blocks

for your sales funnels. You will find that certain blocks work better at
certain points on your Value Ladder, but remember, they are just blocks.
You can move them around as you

please. Markets respond according to a huge variety of factors. What works
in my world

might need a little tweaking in yours.

In the upcoming chapters, I’m going to show you some of my favorite ways
to

connect the blocks to create working sales funnels. I highly recommend you
start with my

version, simply because I’ve tested these in the real world over and over. I
know what works in general. Then if you want to try moving things around,
go for it! You may discover an approach I never thought of before.

The twenty-three blocks I use most often are used at specific times during
four specific phases in the funnel: the pre-frame bridge, qualifying
subscribers, qualifying buyers, and identifying hyperactive buyers.
Remember, these four points all happen at the

point of sale. Any time you sell anything through a funnel (which should be
most of the


time), you’re going to move your buyer through these four points. Most
often, you’ll be

creating new funnels during the _age and ascend_ and _change selling
environment_ phases.

When you do that, simply go back to these building blocks and create a new
funnel.

Okay, let’s get started.

**PRE-FRAME BRIDGE**

The following are the most common building blocks I use for pre-frames.
Remember, the

goal with a pre-frame is to warm up the prospects so they are in the correct
frame of mind to be most receptive to your offer.

**Quizzes:** A quiz is my new favorite pre-frame tool. If you’re on Facebook,

it’s difficult to escape all the “What famous actor are you?” or “What jungle
animal are you?” quizzes. They seem to get more and more ridiculous all
the

time. (This morning, I saw one that asked, “What type of storm are you?”

Really.) The questions you ask don’t matter much; you just want to get
people engaged in the process.

To get a great pre-frame, you want to get people thinking along the same

lines as the next step in the funnel. Agitate the problem your business
solves for

them. Use the quiz questions to help them remember how much they hate
weeds


in their lawn or being rejected by women. One technique I love to use is to
frame

the first question like this:

Fig 11.1: A simple pre-frame quiz before someone joins your email list.

If you require people to opt-in (give you an email address) to get their quiz

results, you’ve killed two birds with one stone. The prospect has moved
through

both the pre-frame and the qualify subscribers phases in the funnel. Then
you try

to qualify him as a buyer by making an offer immediately after he opts-in.

Now, you may be wondering how many questions to include and how to get

people to stay with the quiz all the way to the end. I like to use three or four
questions, and I number each one so they know how much farther they have
to go


(Step 1 of 4, Step 2 of 4 ...). I do know some companies that use up to
twenty

questions or more in their quizzes with great success. Just like everything
else, this is something you might want to test out to determine what is right
for your

unique market.

Another great reason to use quizzes is that you can segment your audience
according

to their answers. You might ask, “Do you have a dog or a cat?” Then you
segment your

list according to the responses. With sophisticated quiz programs, you can
even have the

subsequent questions match the two segments. So, your next question to the
“dog”

segment of responders might be, “How old is your dog?” Then offer answer
choices like

zero to one, under five years, under ten years, over ten years, etc. How does
this help you sell more pet food? Well, puppies need different nutrition than
older dogs. If you know how old their dog is, you can sell them exactly the
right type of food. Also, if you know

the quiz taker has a dog, not a cat, the ad on the next page should picture a
dog. The quiz helps you segment your buyers, as well as pre-frame your
offer.


FIG 11.2: Quizzes are great tools for engaging your audience and getting
their

brains primed for your sales page.

**Articles:** I love to use articles as a pre-frame for cold traffic coming from a

banner ad. These can be articles on your website, but I find they’re more
effective

if they appear on someone else’s site. It’s like a third-party endorsement.
Here’s

how it works.

Someone clicks your banner ad and lands on a website with a pre-frame

article. It might be a case study of how you helped an individual solve a
problem.

It might be an article about how your product works. Or it might not have


anything to do with you specifically, but it sets up the problem and what is
required to solve that problem.

Then you add a call to action somewhere on the page. A call to action is

simply where you ask the reader to do something: click here to learn more,

subscribe today, get your free sample here. In an article, the call to action
can be

a simple link inside the text, a big button at the bottom of the article, a
photo with

a link, or a combination of these.

Now, don’t be unethical here. For a while, many Internet marketers used
this

technique successfully with fake news sites and fake blogs that they
controlled.

The FTC cracked down on that practice, and you really don’t want them on
your

case. Use legitimate articles on legitimate websites. Encourage one of your
best

students to write an article about you, then use that as the landing page
people will see once they click on a banner ad.

**News:** Anything that’s news _or is perceived as news_ commands more

attention than other reading matter. Our brains are programmed to pay
special

attention to anything that might be a threat. This is why everything on the

evening news is a “Special Alert” or “Disaster Update.” Each headline is
phrased


to get our attention and convince us a developing event is sure to destroy
the world as we know it. If your pre-frame is attached somehow to a current
news

story, you’ll automatically receive a bump in attention for as long as that
story continues to dominate the news. For example, if you manage to tie
your message

to an upcoming election or natural disaster, people will see the connection
and pay more attention to you as a result. The downside to this strategy is
that the recognition can be short lived. However, the upside can be a
massive upsurge in

traffic while the story is hot.

You can also design the web page to look like a news page. It might have a


special bar with a headline on the bottom or a sidebar with a relevant side
story.

Marketers have found that just formatting their content to look like news
can

increase their credibility and pre-frame their offers nicely. Again, don’t go
crazy

with this strategy, or you’ll have the FTC on your case. Besides, it’s just bad
for

business. Be ethical. Tell the truth.

Fig 11.3: Articles on news sites lend a feeling of authority to your products
and

services.

**Blogs:** A blog post can be used to pre-frame most any topic. For example,
maybe you work in a crowded industry with many competitors who all
provide

basically the same solution. You could write a blog post explaining how
every

other company is the same, while yours is different and better. You might
write

the article yourself and post it on your blog. But you’ll probably get better
results

if you guest post it on someone else’s blog, preferably a high-traffic blog
with lots of visitors in your target market. Better yet, have the blog author
post the article in their name so that you are not seemingly tied to it at all. I
did this once


with a successful student in the “make-money-online” market. I asked him
to

write an article detailing his experience using my products. He added a link
to our offer, and we drove Facebook traffic to his blog post. The campaign
worked

great. It was engineered as a pre-frame, but the content was 100% true and

ethical.

**Videos:** YouTube videos make great pre-frame material, especially for

testimonials. The video should agitate the problem for the viewer or educate
them


on some process or idea. The goal is to make them desire the solution you
offer.

Again, have the video appear on someone else’s channel and drive traffic
there.

Then include calls to action that move people to your offer. The calls to
action might be links in the description or comments, some pre-roll or post-
roll footage,

or even annotations in the video.

**Email:** Pre-framing with email works well when you buy a solo ad or use
JV

partners to endorse you to their lists. No matter whose list you’re mailing
to, you’re essentially borrowing their credibility to pre-frame you as a great
person

or to pre-frame your offer as a great solution. Once the pre-frame is

accomplished, the call to action is a link in the email that readers can click
on to

get to your offer. With direct mail, this is done with a lift letter where the
owner

of the list writes an introduction telling his people how great you are or how
well

your product works. JV partners or affiliates do the same thing with email
by writing an introduction for you or your offer.

Fig 11.4: Presell pages educate the visitor before they land on your sales
page.

**Presell Pages:** Sometimes you have to educate people before you sell to
them. A presell page tells a story. It’s a longer article used to give


background information or education that prospects might need. Once they
have this

information, they are in the right frame of mind to understand and buy the
offer.

For example, maybe you sell email marketing software, but some of your

prospects don’t know what email marketing is or why their businesses need
it.

You might send them to a presell page on your website that explains exactly
how

email marketing helps grow businesses. Then you add a call to action,
which will

take them to your product offer. This strategy works great for affiliates who
want

to warm up the prospect before sending them straight over to someone
else’s

sales page.

**QUALIFYING SUBSCRIBERS**

The next phase is to qualify your subscribers. Remember the goal here is
simply to get people to opt-in to your list, subscribe to your newsletter, or
request a free offer you’ve put in front of them. You’re separating out the
casual visitors from the people who are willing to trade their email
addresses in return for more information.

**Pop-Ups:** Remember years ago when those annoying little boxes popped
up

on your screen almost every time you visited a website? “Congratulations!
You


just won ... blah, blah, blah.” They may have been annoying, but they
worked

like crazy to get people to opt in to a list. Thanks to pop-up blockers and ad
blockers, this method became almost obsolete for years, and marketers all
but

abandoned them. But recently new types of pop-ups have been created that
aren’t

as easily blocked, and we’re finding that these pop-ups are becoming a
good tool

for building a list in many situations. The bigger problem is that some
advertisers

(like Google and Facebook) won’t approve ads that go to pages with pop-
ups. So

this method doesn’t work all the time, but pop-ups can be powerful tools
under

the right circumstances.


Fig 11.5: Pop-ups can still be effective if used carefully.

**Squeeze Page:** The squeeze page is the simplest way to qualify subscribers.

It was developed as a way to increase subscribers without using pop-ups.
It’s a simple opt-in page that requires people to give you their email
addresses to get access to something on the next page (i.e., a free report or a
free video). The only

choices on the page are to subscribe or leave. The magic of a squeeze page
is the

complete lack of distractions. There are no ads to look at and no navigation
menu

tabs to click. People are forced to focus on your most important message—
the one message you want to give them. And they have to make a decision:
either

give you their email address or leave the page.


Fig 11.6: A squeeze page has only one goal—to get the visitor to subscribe
or

request information.


**Squeeze Pop:** The squeeze pop is a way to get people to join your list via a

button on your blog or other web pages. When they click on that button, up
pops

a squeeze-page-style pop-up. If a visitor gives you their email address, they
are taken to the next page. Squeeze pop buttons are great because you can
place them

in a ton of places, places where you traditionally wouldn’t be able to get
opt-ins,

like articles and blog posts.

Fig 11.7: A squeeze-pop combines a clickable button with a pop-up web
form.

**Free-Plus-Shipping, Two-Step Form:** This type of web form takes

advantage of buyer psychology and combines the “qualify subscribers” and

“qualify buyers” steps into one sequence. Step one qualifies subscribers by


asking for contact information (including email addresses). Step two
qualifies

buyers by asking for credit card information, usually to cover shipping
costs.

That is how my company structures most of our free-plus-shipping offers.

Fig 11.8: A two-step web form allows you to collect a name and email
address on

step one and credit card information on step two.

Anyone who fills out step one of this form is automatically added to an
email

list and is qualified as a subscriber—even if he doesn’t fill out step two.

**Webinar Registration:** We often use free webinars as a way to generate

leads. When people register for the webinar, they naturally need to give you
their

email addresses because you need to send them details about the webinar. If
it’s

an automated webinar, they pick which day they want to watch, fill in their
email,

and Boom! A new subscriber is on your list. And because they signed up
for a webinar, they’ll be looking for your email.


Fig 11.9: Webinar registrations are a natural way to collect email addresses

because people expect you to send them more information about the
webinar via

email.


**Free Account:** Signing people up for a free account works especially well
with software and membership programs. Create a membership site, or a
“lite”

version of your software, and give it to people for free. When visitors create
an

account to get access to the membership or the software, they are added to
your

subscriber list. Often times, these types of pages are very similar to squeeze
pages, but because they are actually “creating an account,” you can get a lot
more

information and still keep your conversions high.

Fig 11.10: Free accounts allow you to collect more personal information
about a

subscriber like physical address and phone number.

**Exit Pop:** An exit pop is, not surprisingly, a last-chance pop-up after people

click away from your site. It asks if they’re sure they really want to leave
without

subscribing. You may even make a special offer to people if they decide to


subscribe before they close the exit pop. Once people leave your site,
there’s a good chance they’ll never come back. So, you can afford to annoy
them a little

bit with an exit pop. It may be your last chance to keep them engaged with
you.

Fig 11.11: You can use exit pops as a final appeal to the visitor to give you
their

email address.

**QUALIFYING BUYERS**

When we qualify buyers, remember that the goal is to get people to pull out
their credit cards and actually pay for something. The first purchase is the
hardest to get, so it’s best to offer something of value for a very low price.


Then, you can guide buyers up the Value Ladder as soon as you can. Here
are my favorite ways to qualify buyers:

**Free-Plus-Shipping:** This is my favorite way to qualify buyers (as you’ll
see

in Secret #13). If you create a great product and give it away for free, it is
the perfect bait and gets one of your products into the hands of a new
customer.

There is no better way than a free-plus-shipping offer to provide value up
front and get the buyer interested in ascending. I feel like this tactic is the
best way to

find out which of your subscribers are also buyers.

**Trial:** A very low-cost trial offer is a great way to get people to raise their
hands and tell you that they’re buyers. The easiest and most popular trial is
offered for one dollar. Then, you bill them a few days later for the full
amount—

if they want to keep the product. To receive the trial, a visitor must pull
their credit card out of their wallet and prove they are a buyer. This works
best for

items you don’t have to ship, like digital downloads, software, or
membership sites.

**Tripwire:** Tripwires are smaller offers used to get buyers in the door. They

are often a “splinter” of your core product. For example, you might pull out
one

module or one of the training sessions and offer it for a huge discount. Ryan
Deiss and Perry Belcher made this technique popular. They usually use a
very

low-cost offer of around seven dollars per item. These can be physical
products


or digital downloads, depending on your market.

**Self-Liquidating Offers (SLO):** These types of offers are usually a little
more expensive—between thirty-seven and ninety-seven dollars. Often
times,

with free-plus-shipping, trials, and tripwire offers, you may actually lose
money

initially, although through your upsells you can often break even. With a
self-liquidating offer, on the other hand, the goal is to have the frontend
product liquidate your ad costs so that your upsells can become pure profit.

**Straight Sale:** This is just a regular sale of a high-ticket item, from ninety-

seven to five thousand dollars or higher. It usually takes a little more selling
to convert these offers, so we typically only introduce this option to people
who are

in our warm market or who have gone through our initial funnels. It usually
takes

a stronger bond with the Attractive Character before people will make these

larger investments.

Many people ask me what type of offer they should use to qualify their
buyers. Most

of the time, I like to use the free-plus-shipping offer to qualify my buyers,
but it doesn’t always work. We tried this with our neuropathy supplement,
and the numbers never quite

worked out. So we changed it to a straight sale, and it worked great.
Sometimes you try

something that doesn’t work, so you change the offer. Simply shift to one of
the other building blocks, and you could have a winner. You have to test


each product. Different markets respond differently, so don’t give up on
finding interested buyers too soon.

**IDENTIFY HYPERACTIVE BUYERS**

To figure out which customers are hyperactive buyers at the point of sale, I
need to offer an upsell immediately after I qualify them with a low-cost or
free offer. Here are my favorite ways to do that:

**Bumps:** These are the little offers we add on to our order forms, and they
have completely transformed our business. This concept is very similar to
the

experience you have in a grocery store checkout line. You see the candy
bars, gum, and other little things that are all too easy to throw in with your
order. My

team does a similar thing with our order-form bumps. With two lines of text
and

a checkbox, we are often able to get up to 40% of our buyers to upgrade and
pay

an extra thirty-seven dollars or more at the point of sale.


Fig 11.12: Bumps are a subtle way to increase sales (sometimes
dramatically).

Just make a simple discount offer with a checkbox on the order form.

**One-Time Offers (OTOs):** After someone has purchased any of your

frontend offers, you can make them a special, onetime offer. The best OTOs
are

products that will complement the initial purchase. Often we’ll make two to
three

separate offers to people after they buy, as long as the sequence of offers
adds more value to the initial offer.


Fig 11.13: One Time Offers (OTOs) appear after someone has purchased
your

first offer. These are special deals they can only get if they act right away.

**Downsales:** If the buyer says no to the OTO, you can downsell them with
either a different product or a payment plan option on the original offer.
Don’t give up just because they said no to paying the full amount all at
once. Often we

find that up to 20% of people who say no to the special offer will say yes to
a payment-plan version on a downsell.

**Affiliate Recommendations:** These recommendations typically happen
after


buyers finish going through my upsale/downsale sequenece and have
landed on

the “thank you” page in my funnel. On this page, I will usually thank
buyers for

ordering and then link to other offers that would likely serve them.

**Let’s Review:** Do you see how these blocks work to build a system that
benefits your company? Simply go through each phase in the funnel and
choose which block you want

to try. You’ll soon discover the ones that work best in your market, and
you’ll rely on them over and over. But don’t forget to test out some of the
alternatives now and then. You never know when a straight sale will beat
out a trial for a particular offer—unless you test it. I encourage you to split
test different blocks for all your offers. I know split testing can be
intimidating for some, and the software can be expensive. But I think it’s so
important to the long-term growth of your business that we included simple
split testing options inside ClickFunnels to make it super easy.

**Up Next:** New ideas for building blocks are being developed all the time,
but these listed above are the most common and most effective, I’ve found.
Now that you know

what the blocks are, we can start building actual funnels.

In the next chapter, I’m going to discuss which types of funnels we use on
the frontend of our Value Ladders, the ones we use in the middle, and those
we use for the backend. Understanding this will help you to better
understand how to use each of the funnels I will be giving you later.


## SECRET #12:

## FRONTEND VS. BACKEND FUNNELS

Now that you know the building blocks, all you have to do to build your
own funnels is

put them together. You can combine them any way you like, but I have
seven tested and

proven funnels that I use all the time with my mastermind clients and with
my own companies. We use them over and over and over again, and they
work. In section 4, you’re

going to learn how each of these funnels functions. But before we go there,
you need to

see how we use different funnels for different steps on the Value Ladder.
Funnels have a


psychology behind them, and you need to use a different psychological
approach for a low-priced, introductory product vs. a high-ticket package.

**Product Awareness Continuum:** The basic psychology goes back to the
product awareness continuum we discussed when we were talking about
traffic temperature in Secret #9.

Fig 12.2: How you speak to your prospects depends on where they are on
the

product awareness continuum.

Cold traffic is probably only aware of the problem they are facing. They
don’t know

you or your products, so they need to start at the front of the Value Ladder
with a low-level funnel, like a Free-Plus-Shipping or Self-Liquidating-Offer
Funnel. These funnels are proven to work on cold traffic, people who don’t
know you or the solution you’re providing.

These potential customers will start to warm up to you after they start going
through

your communication funnel—building a bond with the Attractive Character.
As they do, you can start introducing biggerticket products through the
funnels we use in the middle of the Value Ladder. I like to sell these mid-
priced offers using a Perfect Webinar Funnel, Invisible Funnel, or Product-
Launch Funnel. Each of these takes the time to go into more

detail about the solution you’re providing with your product, so the sales
funnel is a little different.

Hot traffic already knows you, likes you, and trusts you. They know your
products, so

it’s time to direct them to the backend as you focus on the highest level of
service you can offer. Because these offers have a greater price, you


probably aren’t going to be able to close many sales using online methods
alone. You need to change the selling environment

and get the prospect on the phone or to a live event. My favorite funnel for
moving people from the computer to the phone is the High-Ticket, Two-
Step Funnel.

In the upcoming chapters, I’m also including my favorite sales scripts to
help you write the sales letters and videos you’ll need to include in your
funnels. You’ll want to tweak them by adding in the details for your
company and your market. Think of these scripts like a framework—all the
elements you need are there, and you simply add in the

details.

Before we go through these funnels and scripts, there are a few things to
keep in mind:

1.

These funnels start on the landing page. They do not cover the traffic

temperature or the pre-frame bridge. They are the sales mechanisms
designed to

move a person from being a completely anonymous visitor to becoming a

paying customer. Traffic and pre-frame are important elements, too, so be
sure

to consider them carefully when deciding which funnel to use.

2.

When you’re ready to “age and ascend” customers on your Value Ladder,
all

you have to do is create a new funnel. The people you age and ascend will
now


be considered warm traffic, so you can treat them like old friends and
approach

your funnels from that perspective.

3.

3. Some of these funnels and scripts are short and sweet. Some are very
long and

involved. Generally, the higher up on the Value Ladder you are, the more
selling

you have to do and the longer your script will be. Although, if you have hot

traffic, you can sometimes get away with a less involved script.

**THE BIG PICTURE**

Fig 12.3: The core funnel moves people from the traffic stage all the way up
the

Value Ladder.


Before we move on to the individual funnels, let’s zoom out and look at the
big picture,

how everything we’ve talked about so far ties together. Figure 12.3 shows
the overall framework of each of our companies.

Traffic that we control, we drive to a squeeze page. Traffic that we don’t
control, we

drive to a blog where the top third of the page collects email addresses. As
soon as someone joins, through either of those sources, they become traffic
that we own, and we

start sending them the Soap Opera Sequence so that they can build a
relationship with the

Attractive Character. When that sequence is done, we start sending daily
Seinfeld emails

to help them ascend through the other offerings on our Value Ladder.

Now, immediately after a person joins my list, through either the squeeze
page or the

blog, they are taken to my first frontend offer. This is the offer I use to
qualify my buyers.

Those who purchase that product will immediately see a few point-of-sale
upsells.

After that initial transaction is over, my email sequences will start to
encourage people to purchase other products as they ascend my Value
Ladder and join my continuity

programs. I will use different types of funnels to sell people different
products in the Value Ladder.

Figure 12.3 shows you the overview of everything we’ve discussed so far at
a higher


level. This is how I view companies when I first start working with them.
After I see what a business looks like from this highlevel view, I can easily
see what is broken and then dive into the specifics to get the results the
owners want and need.

I encourage you to take what you’ve learned so far, along with what you are
currently

doing in your company, and use this image to find your holes. Determine
what you need to

change or create in order to build your solid foundation.

## SECRET #13:

## THE BEST BAIT

I have one last thing to share with you before I give you access to my seven
proven funnels. I think if you understand this one crucial concept, it will
change how you build

your sales funnels. When I discovered what I am about to share, it literally
changed my company overnight. I went from making about thirty thousand


dollars a year online to making over seven figures in less than eighteen
months.

**THE ONE-HUNDRED-VISITOR TEST**

Back when I was twelve years old and a newly addicted junk mail collector,
I remember

calling 1-800 numbers every day and ordering free information. It didn’t
matter what the

information was about—it was free and I wanted it. Free samples and free
trials are everywhere, online and off. Why? Because they work like crazy to
get people’s attention.

Humans just can’t resist the word _FREE._

If you haven’t read the book _Predictably Irrational_ by Dan Ariely, I highly
recommend you pick up a copy and read it. In this book, the author talks
about an experiment studying the effects of the word _free_ on buying
behavior.

You can read about the entire experiment in his book, but here’s the relevant
part for

this chapter: Researchers offered a group of students a Lindt Truffle for
twenty-six cents

and a Hershey’s Kiss for one cent and then observed buying behavior. They
found that about 40% of participants went for the Kiss, while 40% chose
the Lindt Truffle. When researchers dropped the price of both chocolates by
one cent, suddenly 90% of the students took the free Kiss, even though the
relative price between the two was still the same. Researchers also ran tests
in which they lowered the price from two cents to one cent to see if it
increased demand for the Kiss, but it didn’t. They ran other tests where they
lowered the price from free to negative one cent, but they still didn’t see
any changes in buying behavior. They ran this same experiment over and


over on college students, children, older adults, and more, yet the results
stayed the same. There was power in _free!_

I thought that was a pretty cool concept, and it got me excited to implement
this concept in my company. I asked myself, _How can I offer something in
my business for free?_ If everyone in my industry or my town is offering
discounted products, but I can offer mine for free, suddenly the majority of
people are going to choose me. So, how can I structure my offer to give
something away for free?

I started trying things out and testing the results to see which offers I could
give away

to get the biggest response.

Eventually, I came up with my own experiment to test the effects of
offering

something for free. I call it my One-Hundred-Visitor Test. I ran it many
times in different environments with different target audiences and
products, and the results were pretty consistent in almost every test we ran.
While we ran this test with hundreds of thousands

of website visitors, I broke it down and simplified the findings to show
what our core numbers looked like for every hundred visitors we sent
through this test funnel.

Here’s how it worked: I sent one hundred people to a website where they
could purchase a product. The product was offered for $197. We paid a
talented copywriter and

tested different pitches until we got a high-converting page. After all the
testing and tweaking, we wound up getting about 1% of cold traffic to
convert and buy the product.

So, for every one hundred visitors, we made $197, and we got one new
customer on our


list. Most marketers would consider that result about average.

Then we started shifting things around and experimented with offering
something for

free. We wanted to see how this new offer would change the metrics and
our income. So,

we splintered off one of the best parts of our product and put it into a form
we could ship to our customers for free if they’d help cover the shipping
costs. We offered to put this information on a CD, a DVD, or a book. After
people signed up for the free-plus-shipping

offer, then we’d immediately upsell them on the same $197 product we
were trying to sell

before. I figured I would lose money because I was making people pull out
their credit cards and buy the free-plus-shipping offer before they even saw
the $197 offer. I mean, if only one-tenth of potential customers ever even
saw the $197 offer, logically I should make less money, right?

Here’s what happened: We sent people to the website, and on average, a
whopping 8% of people purchased the free-plus-shipping offer. (Remember,
that’s up from 1% on the original page. And the free-plus-shipping page
needed almost NO copy to sell, whereas on the original $197 page, we had
to include really convincing text to persuade

people to buy.)

Now, this is where the magic happens. Because the customer had
ALREADY pulled a

credit card out of their wallet and made a commitment towards the concept
we were selling, about 25% of free-plus-shipping customers bought the
upsell offer. That means we

made $394 per one hundred visitors, and we got eight new buyers on our
list. I almost doubled my money and got seven times more customers by


adding in a **free** -plus-shipping offer! Pretty cool, huh?

I don’t know what it is about buyer psychology, but once you get someone
to say the

first yes, it’s so much easier to get the second yes. It’s a slippery slope. You
get them started by saying yes to a small thing, then they are much more
likely to say yes to a larger thing later.

People ask me if they can just sell (or just give away) a digital product
instead of the

free-plus-shipping offer. The answer is yes, you can, but you are missing
out on some very powerful things. I like to make the free offer physical
because it gives me the ability to use the word _free,_ while also requiring the
interested customer to pull out their credit card to pay for shipping and
qualify as a buyer. If I decide to sell this as a digital product for a small
price, then I lose the power of free. And if I just give it away free digitally,
then I lose the power of qualifying the buyer when they pay the shipping
costs. I also lose the ability to do a one-click upsell on the next page. Does
that make sense?

Over the years, this concept has continued to evolve, as you’ll see in the
coming chapters showing you the funnels. My team started adding multiple
upsells after the initial free-plus-shipping offer, and we saw a huge increase
in revenues. We also created sales scripts that work almost universally
across most of the markets we’ve tested them in.

You’ll get to learn more about those funnels and scripts and the evolution of
our process in the next section of this book. However, the _biggest_
advancement we stumbled upon was the order form bump. Let me explain
how it works.

**THE FREE-PLUS-SHIPPING ORDER FORM BUMP**

After many initial tests, we started testing our free-plus-shipping concept
against our thirty-seven dollar products. What we found is so simple, yet it


has been one of our biggest secrets to increasing our frontend revenue with
almost no effort.

We took our thirty-seven dollar products and tested them against a free CD
—a simple

audio recording teaching one of the most exciting concepts from the
product. We started

driving traffic to both landing pages, and we found that, on average, we
could get about

three times as many customers to pay shipping for the free CD.

So, we had three times as many customers following the “free” route and
that meant

three times as many people were now seeing our upsell path. But we were
missing out on

getting our forty-seven dollar product into the hands of our customers and
losing the extra up-front revenue from this frontend product. In other words,
we were getting more frontend customers, but our average cart value (how
much money you average from each


person who goes through your funnel) was lower, making our revenue come
out about the

same.

Fig 13.1a: Order form bumps take about five minutes to implement and can

dramatically improve your bottom line.

And that’s when we discovered the order form “bump.” We found that by
adding a small box on the order form AFTER someone fills in their credit
card information, but BEFORE they click on the submit button worked
miracles. The small box offered to add

the thirty-seven dollar product on to the order. We wound up with an
average of about 34% of our customers adding the thirty-seven dollar
product to their order!

This meant that by using a free-plus-shipping offer, we immediately got
three times as


many customers, and by adding the forty-seven dollar order form bump
offer, we were also able to get about one out of every three people to also
order the more expensive frontend product. This new tactic gave us almost
the EXACT same frontend revenue, but

it brought three times more people through our upsell flow.

This little secret has allowed us to spend more than our competitors in
almost every

market we’ve ever entered. Even if you don’t use a free-plus-shipping offer
on your frontend (and I think you’re crazy if you don’t), adding this order
form bump to every order form will dramatically increase your cart value
with almost zero effort.

**DOTCOMSECRETS LABS**

Fig 13.2: This is a real example of a free-plus-shipping offer “we made on
my

book _108 Proven Split Test Winners._


Let’s look at a real-world example of the free-plus-shipping principles in
action. On the page shown in figure 13.2, people can get a free physical
book titled _108 Proven Split Test Winners._ It’s one of the best products I’ve
ever created, and I was originally going to charge $997 for it. But after
fighting with myself for a few weeks, I finally decided to follow my own
advice. Instead of charging the amount I thought it was worth, I resolved

to get it into the hands of as many people as possible. So I made it a free-
plus-shipping offer. I knew when I created it that anyone who got this
product in their hands would be a raving Russell Brunson fan for the rest of
their life and would want to ascend my Value

Ladder. On the order form we added a “bump” for our Conversion Krusher
template for

just thirty-seven dollars. Then after someone purchased the book, our first
upsell was our Instant Traffic Hacks product for $197, our second upsell
was my Perfect Webinar product

for $297, and our last upsell was my High-Ticket Secrets program for $997.
We started to

drive traffic to “sell” my free book, and the results that came back were
amazing. For each free book we gave away, we averaged about sixty-six
dollars in _immediate_ revenue from the upsells!

With numbers like that, just think how much more I can spend to acquire
customers.

And once we acquire someone as a customer, we continue to lead them up
our Value Ladder to other products and services. So the revenue only
continues to grow.

**HOW DOES THIS WORK IF YOU’RE AN ...**

**Author, Coach, or Consultant:** Think of the most amazing results you
could get for your clients, the one thing that would really solve their biggest


problem, and put the information into a book, CD, or DVD. You may
hesitate and feel some resistance to this

suggestion. Many people think, _Oh no, I can’t give that away ... it’s my
secret sauce!_ Trust me. Give it away for free, and you’ll reap the benefits on
the backend.

**eCommerce Business:** Tailor this concept to your space. For example, if
you’re selling something like birdcages, you could give away a CD titled
_How to Teach Your Parrot to Talk._ Or, maybe you sell custom suits; you
could offer free cuff links. See how this works?

**Network Marketer:** For this niche, you could create a CD or DVD
showing your secret method of finding leads or converting them into
distributors. You can then use this bait to attract people who are already
interested in network marketing and who you know

will make great distributors for your team.

**Affiliate Marketer:** Create your own informational CD or DVD to give
away and build your own list and then sell other people’s offers on the
backend. You can even interview someone with more knowledge about the
industry for your free-plus-shipping offer.

**Offline Business Owner:** Think about your business and the problems you
help to solve. Figure out the biggest problem for your potential customers
and share your unique

solution. Record that solution on a CD or DVD and give it away as a free-
plus-shipping

offer. Or find a physical product you can offer for free-plus-shipping—
anything that will

attract consumers and get buyers into your Value Ladder.

**Let’s Review:** The secret to converting cold traffic is leveraging the power
of free.


Whatever you’re sharing in your free-plus-shipping offer, it can’t be boring,
general knowledge. It has to be unique, sexy, or fun—the more unique, the
better. Using free-plus-shipping offers is the fastest way to qualify your
buyers and get people into your Value Ladder. Remember, if someone isn’t
willing to pull out a credit card and pay a few bucks

for shipping on your product, then they probably aren’t going to buy your
other products

either.

**Up Next:** Now that we’ve covered all the strategy behind Value Ladders
and how to

turn those into sales funnels, would you like to see the seven core sales
funnels we use in our companies, as well as the exact scripts we use to sell
each of those products? In the

next section, I will be revealing the nuts and bolts behind building your
winning campaigns.

**SECTION FOUR:**

**FUNNELS AND SCRIPTS**

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Before we start this section, I want to point out that each of these funnels,
and their accompanying scripts, serve a different purpose. I use all of them
at different points in our company and at different levels of our Value
Ladder. I also want to mention that both the

sales funnels and the scripts are just a framework that form a starting point.
Once we get the basic framework of a funnel working, we add on other
components to grow it into a

larger, more complete sales funnel. For example, for the Free-Plus-Shipping
Funnel I described in the last chapter, we added an order form bump as well
as three upsells or onetime offers (OTOs) to build the final funnel.


The scripts I’m giving you in this section are also just a framework. You
need to add

in your personality, the elements of your Attractive Character that will
make these static scripts come to life. So use these funnels and scripts as the
starting point, but don’t be afraid to tweak them for your company’s needs.

One of the biggest questions I get about funnels is this: _How in the world do
I actually build these out so they all flow together the way they’re supposed
to?_ I don’t want the technology factor to get in the way of implementing
what you’ve learned in this book.

Each of the funnels I’m about to show you can easily be built out in
ClickFunnels.com. In section 5, you will get a full tutorial on how to use
ClickFunnels to build out these funnels.

**FRONTEND FUNNELS**

## FUNNEL #1:

## TWO-STEP, FREE-PLUS-SHIPPING

The Two-Step Funnel works really well for the free-plus-shipping offers we
discussed earlier. The first page typically has a video using the Who, What,
Why, How script you’ll


see below. Then the page asks visitors, _“Where should I ship this?”_ They
fill out the shipping address form (that’s step one) and then move on to step
two where they fill in credit card information for the shipping and handling
charge. It’s important that you mention on the first page that the buyers will
be charged for shipping and handling.

Otherwise, it’s very unethical, and you’ll upset your customers before they
even have a chance to get into your Value Ladder, which is never a good
idea. As we mentioned before, adding an order form bump on step two is a
great way to increase frontend revenues. Now, not everyone who fills out
step one will fill out step two, so I capture the email address on the first
step. That way, I can follow up with them later and ask them to go back and
fill out the rest of the form.

After the visitors fill out the second step and click the submit button, you
take them to

a special, one-time offer (OTO), which presents an opportunity to upgrade
the order. I’ll

explain the psychology behind how to structure your offer for the OTOs
when I share with

you the sales script we use. Figure 14.1 shows one OTO, but often we’ll
have two or three

upsells and downsells in our funnels, so you don’t have to limit yourself to
just one additional offer.

The psychology behind this funnel is amazing. People are more likely to fill
out the

first step because they don’t see a long form asking for credit card
information. Then once they do get to the credit card form, they keep filling
it out because their brains are already committed to the process.
Interestingly, I often find conversions to be higher on step one


than on a regular email squeeze page, even though I’m asking for an entire
shipping address instead of just a short email. This is probably because
receiving something physical in the mail has a higher perceived value than
receiving digital information via email.

You can see a live example at
[http://www.DotComSecretsBook.com/resources/cfdemo.](http://www.DotComSecretsBook.com/resources/cfdemo.)

**THE WHO, WHAT, WHY, HOW SCRIPT**

This is the script I typically use with the Two-Step Funnel. Inexpensive
offers like free-plus-shipping items usually don’t require a long, involved
sales letter. You need to hit the main selling points and build credibility as
quickly as you can. Just create a little video, answering these four questions,
and maybe add in a text version on the page. Present step

one on the order form, and you’re all set. This is a short and simple script
that answers the main questions likely on the prospects’ minds as they look
at a low-end offer.

**Who:** Who are you? Introduce yourself very briefly.

_“Hi, I’m Russell Brunson, founder of DotComSecrets. “_


**What:** What do you have? Introduce your product or offer briefly.

_“I’ve got a free DVD that’s going to show you_________________.”_

**Why:** Why do they need it? Explain the benefits of the offer.

_“If you’ve been struggling with_, then you need this_

_DVD because it will ___________.”_

**How:** How can they get it? Walk them through the order process so they
know what

to expect.

_“Just fill out the form on the side of this page. Let me know your shipping
address, and I’ll send it out right away. “_

**The Catch:** Tell them why you’re offering this product for such a low
price. People

always think there’s a catch. So instead of avoiding the topic, let them
know, in clear terms, that there is no catch.


_“There’s no catch. I’m doing this because ___________._ All I need for you
to do

is to help with shipping and handling _charges.”_

**Urgency:** Explain why they should order this product right now.

_“I only have a very limited number of copies, so don’t be left behind.”_

_“This offer ends at midnight on ___________. Don’t wait. “_

**Guarantee:** Reverse any risk in ordering the product.

_“If you don’t love it, I’ll refund your money, and you can keep the DVD.”_

**Recap:** Remind them what they are getting and why.

_“One more time, here’s what you’re getting:__.”_

**Let’s Review:** The Two-Step Funnel is great for converting cold traffic and
getting a visitor to qualify as a subscriber and buyer. The sales process is
short and sweet because you’re selling something at the low end of your
Value Ladder.

**Up Next:** Now, after they have made the initial purchase, use a different
script to sell the special, one-time offer. Let’s look at that script now.

**THE OTO SCRIPT**

OTO stands for One Time Offer. It’s a special offer you make to people
who just purchased a product from you. We use this script for the OTO on
all of our offers (not just the Two-Step Funnel), so know that you can and
should use this script for any upsell situation. In the past, I would try to use
a longer sales process in the OTO, but I never had great conversions with
the longer version. It wasn’t until my team wrote our script so that the focus
is more on confirming the initial purchase and then quickly convincing
them to


say the second yes that we saw dramatically better results. Usually this
OTO video is only

three to five minutes long, yet it will close people on price points from
ninety-seven dollars to two thousand or more.

Now, one of the keys you need to understand before you use this script is
how to structure your OTO. Getting the second yes is 80% offer structure
and 20% script. So here

are a few guidelines to make sure you structure the offer correctly.

**Rule #1: Don’t Sell More of the Same Thing.** This is the biggest mistake
most entrepreneurs make when it comes to upsells. They try to sell more of
what the customer

just bought. Instead, if the customer bought an ebook titled _How to Lose
Weight by Juicing,_ your next offer shouldn’t be another juicing product. In
the visitor’s mind, he has already scratched that itch, so offering more of the
same rarely works.

**Rule #2: Don’t Sell a Random Product.** The next worst thing to selling
more of the

same is to sell a random, unrelated product. I see this all the time. Yet, if
there is no logical connection between the frontend product and the upsells,
you will kill your conversions.

Rather, structure your upsell offer in one of these three ways:

**Sample Structure #1: The Next Thing.** This is my favorite way to do
upsells. If a guy just purchased your book, _How to Lose Weight by Juicing,_
what is the next logical product he needs to buy from you to reach his
goals? He just secured a way to learn how

to juice (so that itch is scratched). But remember that he is juicing to lose
weight. So, outside of juicing, what else will help him to accomplish his


weight-loss goal? Is it a weight-training manual? Would he be interested in
a cardio-related product? Those types

of offers will convert well because it’s the next thing the new customer
needs in order to accomplish his core goal. This is what my team did on the
backend of our _DotComSecrets Labs_ book. The frontend product sold
conversion secrets to a buyer obviously interested in Internet sales, so the
two upsells were related to traffic and then sales.

**Sample Structure #2: Do It Faster.** If you have a way, a tool, a technique,
or a software program that complements the initial offer and helps the
customer get results faster, then the “Do-It-Faster” upsell is the right type of
offer. The one key point to remember is you do NOT want to say the initial
program won’t work without this upsell.

There is no better way to upset your new customers than to tell them that
what they just

bought from you is incomplete without buying more.

**Sample Structure #3: Need Help?** This type of upsell pushes people
farther up your

Value Ladder to your high-end offers. It presents a way to get specially
tailored insight from you. Here we are asking the buyers if they want help
implementing what they just purchased on the frontend.

Now that you understand proven ways to structure the upsell, let me show
you how to

use the OTO script. Below is a pattern of dialogue you can use to create
your own OTO

script. While you should tweak the language to match your individual offer,
try to follow

the order I have provided. I already organized the crucial elements for you,
start to finish.


**Confirm Initial Decision:** It’s important to put any possible buyer’s
remorse to rest by reinforcing the decision to purchase the initial offer. It’s
also important to make sure you keep an “open loop” at this stage. We used
to say things like, “Congratulations, your

order is complete,” before we made the upsell offer, but this language
closed the sales loop. The prospect’s brain was thinking, _I’m finished,_ and it
was hard to get that second conversion. But once we changed that language
to, “Wait! Your order is not yet complete,”

the sales loop remained open, and our conversions went up. Why? Because

subconsciously the reader was still open to being sold on something else.
Pretty cool, huh?

_Congratulations on purchasing ____________. Your order is not quite
finished yet._

**Smart => Why:** Tell the buyer he’s made a great decision by making the
first purchase and why.

_You’ve made a smart choice, and here’s why ..._

_You ordered this because you wanted __________, and that’s exactly what
it’s going_

_to do for you._

**3x 2x Question:** Ask the buyer if he’d like to speed up his results. _How
would you like to get three times the results, twice as fast?_

_How would you like to get ___________ (results) in ___________ (time:
days or weeks)?_

**Exclusive:** Explain why this OTO is not for everyone.

_This offer is NOT for everyone. We’re only making it available to you
because you proved you’re an action taker when you took advantage of_


____________(initial offer). So I’m going to make you a special, one-time
_offer that’s only available right here, right now._

**Results, Fast, Speed:** Explain that this OTO will complement the original
purchase by delivering better results, faster.

_What I’m going to share with you right now will help you to get the results
(fill in the results the customer is wanting) you’re wanting in half the time._

**The One Thing:** Here you need to find the One Thing in your product that
is the key

to the buyer’s success. This part is often tricky because it is tempting to
explain everything about the offer. But if you do that, you will kill the sale.
You need to figure out the One Thing that is the _most_ valuable and will
yield the best results. For example, in my OTO

selling my “Perfect Webinar” system, I have over twenty-four hours of
videos. But instead

of telling the buyers everything they will learn, I focus on one thing, a
special close the video demonstrates called “The Stack.” I explain what it
is, how much money it has made

me, my results, and what type of results the buyer can expect from this
“One Thing.”

_I have another product called ___________. I don’t have time to go over_
everything inside of the product because we could be here for hours, but
one of the strategies inside that will give you the results you’re looking for
FAST is ___________. Let me explain to

you what it is and how it can help you. (Insert explanation.) And that is just
ONE of the

things that you’ll learn with this product.

**Future Pacing:** Help the buyer imagine achieving goals faster and with
greater ease.


_Can you imagine what your life will be like when you have ___________
(the One_

_Thing)?_

**Call to Action (CTA):** Tell the buyer how to order the special offer. _So
click the button below right now to add __________to your order._

**Guarantee:** Reverse the risk he may be feeling with a guarantee. _I
guarantee ___________ or ___________._

**Value Stacking:** Add in valuable bonuses. Here’s a trick for creating
bonuses: take the most valuable part of your product—the thing people
want MOST—pull it out, and offer it as a free bonus. People can’t resist
getting the thing they want most of all for

“free.”

_If you act now, you’ll also receive ___________ , (worth $_______), for
FREE._

And ____________.(worth$________),for FREE. And __________, (worth

$_______), for FREE ...

**Scarcity:** Give them a reason to order right now! Make this a truly one-time
offer.

_This ___________ (product name) is available on my website for_
___________

(higher price). But right now, you have this ONE CHANCE to get it for
only_. This one-

time offer is only available right here, right _now. When you leave this page,
it’s gone forever._

**Second CTA:** Repeat your call to action.


_Don’t miss your chance to _________faster and easier than ever. Click the
button now._

**Testimonial Rush:** Add in testimonials about your product—more is better.

_Don’t just take my word for it, take a look at what others are saying..._

That’s the framework for the OTO script. Now, just like the other scripts,
this is a guide to show you the path you need to lead your customers down
to put them in a state

where they will purchase. You have some freedom to add in your own
personality.

Remember, your Attractive Character is essential to making these scripts
come to life. So

use the script as a guide, but insert your own personality for maximum
conversions.

## FUNNEL #2:

## SELF-LIQUIDATING OFFER

Typically, we use the Self-Liquidating Offer (SLO) Funnel when we are
trying to sell a product that’s priced anywhere from twenty-seven to ninety-
seven dollars. The main goal


is to have this frontend product cover the expenses of buying traffic. You
hope to break even. That is why we call it a “self-liquidating offer”—
because if you structure it right, you won’t have any traffic costs, and your
upsells become pure profit. In general, a free-plus-shipping offer will lose
money on the frontend offer, but will use the upsells to break even or even
make a profit. In contrast, SLOs should break even before any upsells.

First, you’re going to attract people with a free video, report, ebook, or
other lead magnet on your squeeze page. Typically, my “bribe” to get them
to give me an email address is something that I’m going to show them on
the next page in a video or a sales

letter. Then, once the visitors subscribe to your list, they land on your SLO
page, which

sells your core offer. This is generally a video or a long-form-text sales
letter, presenting your SLO using the Star, Story, Solution script described
below. Because the price point is so much higher than a free-plus-shipping
offer, you normally have to use a longer script to get your visitors
comfortable enough to make a purchasing decision. That is what the Star,
Story, Solution script does. On the order form, you can add an order form
“bump,” and then take them into your OTO sequence using the same OTO
script I gave you earlier.

I love the Star, Story, Solution script because it helps to introduce your new
visitors to your Attractive Character while you are selling them your
product.

**STAR, STORY, SOLUTION SCRIPT**


I didn’t invent the concept of the Star, Story, Solution script. I first heard it
when I was interviewing a guy who had made one million dollars in twenty-
three months selling supplements. He said there was a script he used to sell
all of his products. The script formula was so simple! First, you need a star
(I call this person the Attractive Character), then you need a story that
agitates a problem, and finally you need to provide a solution

(your product).

I thought it was a powerful format, but it took me almost ten years to figure
out how


to frame each section of the script. After I figured out how to lead a
prospect through each section, I was able to build out a framework that my
companies (as well as hundreds of our clients) use over and over again.

Sometimes it’s easy to feel overwhelmed with all the pieces in this script—
there are

forty-four! But take it one piece at a time, and you’ll be fine. Each piece can
be as short as a sentence or two, while others might be longer as you find
places to interject your true stories, which define the Attractive Character.
Just think of the forty-four pieces as stepping-stones along the path to the
sale. You can write as much—or as little—as you like for each piece. If you
follow the script, you’ll have a great sales letter by the time you get to the
end. Let’s go through the scripts for all three sections: star, story, and
solution.

**SECTION 1: STAR**

**1. Pattern Interrupt:** This is usually the first thing prospects see. It’s
important to grab their attention, get them out of their current environment
or activity, and suck them into your sales copy. This isn’t always easy to do!
But using a pattern interrupt helps. Here’s an example of a successful
pattern interrupt we used for our pornography addiction product:

_It happened again, didn’t it? To you ... or someone you love._

I know your story ...

_Everyone’s situation is different, but the results are usually the same..._

Often the “core-desire questions” in step two can also work as my pattern
interrupt.

I’ve seen a lot of people who will start their sales videos showing a strange
picture of an unusual object, and then say something like the following:

_“What does this strange turtle have to do with your_? I’m going to show
you in this_


_video, but first...”_

**2. Core-Desire Questions:** Through a series of questions, you get prospects
thinking about the things they desire most. These questions move the brain
to the topic you want to discuss, which is the outcome or results they wish
they could achieve. Here’s an example

of core-desire questions from one of my ListHacking products:

_I’ve got a quick question for you ..._

_Have you ever wanted to work from home?_

_Own your own business?_

_Come on ... you know you want that lifestyle ... the one that everyone talks
about ..._

_Where you can work from home in your underwear ..._

_Or on a beach with your laptop ..._

**3. Agitate Past Failures:** If prospects are taking the time to read your sales
letter, chances are pretty good that this isn’t the first time they’ve thought
about solving this problem. If they already had the desired results, they
wouldn’t be searching online or clicking ads for your product, would they?
So, you already know they’ve probably tried to

achieve the result and failed. This part of the sales letter agitates that failure
in their brains.

Here’s an example:

_So ... why hasn’t it happened for you yet?_

_Come on ... admit it._

_This isn’t the first time you’ve been looking for a proven way to make money
... is it?_


_When is it your turn?_

**4. Big Promise/the One Thing:** Here’s where you introduce your big
promise, the One Thing you’re going to focus on for the rest of the sales
letter.

_When you watch this video to the end, you’re going to discover_
___________.

**5. Introduce the Star:** Right after you introduce your big promise, you
want to

introduce the star of the story. The star is the Attractive Character. I usually
use the reluctant hero persona as my Attractive Character’s identity. But
remember you can use the leader, the adventurer, the reporter, or any other
archetype you think works for your product and your market.

_Hey, my name is Russell. And a few years ago, I was just like you ..._

**SECTION 2: STORY**

Now it’s time to transition into the second section of the sales letter, your
Attractive Character’s story. If you’ve already written your Soap Opera
Sequence, this section will seem very familiar.


**6. High Drama:** Whenever you’re telling a story, you want to start at the
point of high drama. Don’t start with, “Well, I woke up and had eggs for
breakfast ... then I got dressed and went to work ... blah, blah, blah.” Do
start with, “The gun was in my face. I

was staring down the dark barrel, and I could see the bullet in the chamber.
My heart pounded in my ears, and rivers of sweat streamed down my face
...”

Think about your favorite movies. Do they start at the very beginning of the
story, way before the main event occurs? Probably not. A good movie, like
a good story, starts at the point of high drama. The same works for your
sales letters. Present your Attractive Character at a moment that is powerful,
dramatic, and compelling:

_I crawled out from under my desk, almost hitting my head as I grabbed the
phone_

_..._

_“Hello,” I muttered._

“WHAT THE #@%#^$@ ARE YOU DOING!?” responded the stranger on
the other

line.

Confused, I asked him what he was talking about.

“In the past six hours, we have received over thirty spam complaints from
YOUR IP

address ... Russell, you’re a SPAMMER, and we’re shutting off your
Internet access.”

“What!?”

I was so confused ...


I got a lump in my stomach as I hung up the phone and realized that I now
had to explain to my new wife of just six weeks that I’m the reason our
Internet is shut off.

**7. Backstory WALL:** Next you want to fill in the backstory that led up to
the point of high drama. How did you, or your Attractive Character, get
there? It’s important that the

featured character eventually hit a wall, a point where he was completely
stuck. This, by

the way, is where your prospects probably are right now. They have likely
tried to make

money online or lose weight or get whatever result you’re promising, but
they can’t seem

to get the result they want. It feels hopeless.

You see, just six hours earlier, I had “officially” started my new business as
an email

marketer ...

Or so I thought ...

I had been trying to learn online marketing for almost a year now, and I
kept hearing

people talk about how the MOST IMPORTANT thing you can have is ...

Your own email list.

It made total sense to me.

I did the math. If I had ten thousand people on my email list, and I was
selling a five-

dollar product, then I ONLY had to get 1% of them to buy ...


In order to make five thousand dollars ... (1% of 10,000 was 1,000 people x
$5 =

$5K)

_It made total sense ... right?_

_And I saw others doing it. All I needed was an email list._

_I just had no idea how to get one ..._

**8. Identify the Problem:** Now reveal the problem. Let them know why
your Attractive Character was stuck (which is also probably the reason they
are currently stuck). In fact, the more closely you can relate your Attractive
Character’s problem to the readers’ problems, the better.

_The problem I had was _______________._

**9. Epiphany OR Declaration of Independence:** Once the AC pinpoints
the problem,

it’s usually not long before they have an epiphany or decide to make a
major change in their behavior or mindset. For example, your Attractive
Character might have an epiphany

that to make money online, he has to build a list. Or in order to lose weight,
he has to change his eating behavior once and for all.

_And that’s when I had my big “Ah-ha” moment..._

_That’s when I decided I HAD to make a change._

**10. Your Path to Finding the Ultimate Solution:** Take the reader along
your journey. Describe some of the different things you, or your AC, tried
before you found success.

_So, first I tried ______________. That didn’t work at all._

_Then I tried ___________, and it was a little better..._


**11. First Sign of Success:** Let the reader see you start to succeed. Some of
your prospects might be experiencing this feeling at the moment; they
might be right on the cusp of early success. You want them to see you go
through this step so that they know you’ve moved through it to the ultimate
success, and they can, too.

_And that’s when I finally tried ____________. And guess what? This time it
worked!_

**12. Conspiracy:** Show them how you finally realized that the cards were
stacked against you from the start. Your prospects are probably convinced
that the cards are currently stacked against them. Because they believe it,
you need to address this fear through the Attractive Character’s story.

_And that’s when I realized it wasn’t my fault! It’s because of ___________.
No wonder I was struggling!_

**13. The Big Lie:** Explain why it’s not their fault that they haven’t
succeeded before now.

_For years, they had been telling me __________, and when I figured out
that it wasn’t true, I was finally able to break out of their chains and get the
results I deserved._

**14. Common Enemy:** This is who or what is really to blame for the big lie
that was

holding the AC back and blocking his success.

_The real problem is ___________. They were the ones keeping me from_

____________._

**15. Rapid Growth:** Now show them how fast the AC progressed once he
realized the

truth.


_Once I realized ___________ , that’s when we started to ___________
really_

_FAST!_

**16. Case Studies:** Highlight the stories of others who’ve had success
similar to your or the Attractive Character’s story.

_But it wasn’t just me. Take a look at what ______________._ has done for
others.

**17. Hidden Benefits:** Explain the benefits you didn’t expect that have
resulted from the product/discovery you are describing to the reader.

_I didn’t realize when I started that not only does it __________, but it also_

____________,__________, and ___________._

**SECTION 3: SOLUTION**

Now it’s time to bring it all together and wrap up your pitch in a nice, neat
package

(that the readers can buy).

**18. Formal Introduction:** Introduce the product.


_And that’s why I created _____________._

**19. Pain and Cost:** Tell them what you had to go through to create the
product.

_This took ____________.time) to create, and cost me ____________. But it
was_

_totally worth it._

20. Ease: How much effort does the product save you?

_It makes __________ so much easier!_

**21. Speed:** How much time does the product save you?

_What used to take me _____________ (time), I can get done in
______(time)._

**22. “So” Benefits:** Explain why they need this by writing out three or four
benefits followed by the words “so _________.”

_Burns fat while you sleep, so you can lose weight without exercising._

_Builds your list on autopilot, so you can concentrate on running your
business._

**23. Social Proof:** These are your testimonials. Let the prospects read what
others say about the product.

_But don’t just take my word for it. Here’s what others are saying:_

_“This ___________ saves me time and effort every day! I love how it
___________ and ___________ .”_

**24. Make the Offer:** Explain what the buyers will get.

_But, before you get started, let me ask you a question ..._


_Would you like to get access to ___________?_

_For less than the cost of a cheap meal for two, you can get access to
everything_

_inside of _____________._

_Now, while it would be impossible to show you ALL of the benefits of
________, I_

_want to show you some of the things that you’ll experience as soon as
you’re on the_

_inside._

**25. Build Value:** Add bonuses and additional features, but be sure they
support the

“One Thing,” the focus of your entire sales letter.

_Plus, you’ll get __________, ___________, and ___________._

**26. Float a Fake Price:** Tell the readers how much the product “should” be
worth if

they had to pay for each item separately. It should be a number much higher
than the actual price, but you must also make sure the product really is
worth the price you name.

Be ethical. Explain why the high price is justified, based on its value.

_The total value of all this is ________ because __________._

**27. Emotional Close (If/All):** Use the words _“If all_ ...” to help anchor the
offer and help the buyers justify the fake price you named earlier. Use both
“toward pleasure” and

“away from pain” statements.


_If all this did was give you the house of your dreams, would it be worth it?_

_(Toward pleasure.)_

_If all this did was let you fire your boss, would it be worth it? (Away from
pain.)_

**28. Reveal the Real Price:** Now tell the readers how much they are
actually going to pay. This price should be much lower than the high price
you floated earlier.

_I’m not going to charge you ___________. I’m only going to charge you_

___________._

**29. Guarantee (Logic):** Reverse any risk the potential buyers may be
feeling. Give the guarantee some crazy name.

_I’m going to take on all the risk, and give you my ___________ (crazy
name) guarantee._

**30. Inject Scarcity (Fear Close):** Give the buyers a legitimate reason to
buy NOW.

_But you must act now because ___________._

**40. Future Pacing:** Help them see how awesome their lives are about to
become—

after they buy your product.

_Just imagine what life will be like when ___________._

**41. Call to Action:** Tell them what to do to make a purchase. Also, tell the
prospects what’s going to happen next.

_So click on the button below right now, and you’ll be taken to a secure
order form._


_After you put in your credit card information, you’ll be taken to a secure
members’_

_area where you can download _____________, even if it’s 2:00 a.m.!_

**42. Post Selling:** Make the readers feel like they might be left behind if
they don’t hurry.

_For those who are already signing up, this is what’s going to happen next ..._

**43. Take Away Selling (Warning):** Explain that they need to make a
decision, and it

doesn’t matter to you whether they order or not.

_You see ... it doesn’t matter to us if you sign up right now or not._

We’ll still be going about our daily business and hitting our financial goals
with absolute certainty—whether you join our team or not.

However, without our help, you’ll ALWAYS be working harder than you
really need

to.

_I know it sounds kind of harsh, but I think you’ll agree that it’s true._

**44. Close with Reminder:** This is a summary for the skimmers, but it can
remind all

readers of the offer.

_Remember, you get ___________ (recap the offer)._

That’s it. The entire script for a long-form Star, Story, Solution sales letter.
It works

great for both text and video sales letters. Don’t forget, you need to infuse
each of the steps with the personality of the Attractive Character. Use these


forty-four pieces as a framework to get you from the opening lines to the
sale.

## FUNNEL #3:

## CONTINUITY

The last type of frontend funnel that I want to show you is our Continuity
Funnel. One of

my mentors, David Frey, said (and I wholeheartedly agree) that if you don’t
have continuity, then you don’t have a business. In every business, there are
ways to add continuity income, and it’s an essential part of every Value
Ladder. Continuity is when you get paid regularly, usually every month, for
ongoing access to information or software or

some other product.

The funnel itself is very simple. Once a visitor has moved through either a
Two-Step


or an SLO Funnel and made it through my Soap Opera Sequence, then I
will usually send

them through a short email sequence promoting my Continuity Funnel.
Once people are in

the program, they are charged on a regular basis for continuing. Usually,
this is a monthly charge, but it could also be weekly, or yearly.

Many people ask me where they should use Continuity Funnels. You can
use them as

a frontend to generate leads (and we do this with some of our Continuity
Funnels), but I

prefer to use them as the second funnel in my sequence—after my
customers have had a

chance to bond with the Attractive Character. Waiting dramatically
increases our stick rate (how long the customer remains an active, paying
member).

Now, one exciting thing about this funnel is you are able to use the same
scripts that we have already introduced to get people to join your continuity
programs.

If you are selling a free or one-dollar trial, then the Who, What, Why, How
script typically works the best. We’ve also had incredible success adding in
order form bumps that give our customers training on how to use the
continuity program. If you are planning on selling continuity without a trial,
then I would recommend using the Star, Story, Solution script.

After people have purchased the membership, you can create OTOs like we
discussed

earlier. We have found yearly or lifetime accounts to be incredibly effective
upsells with continuity programs.

**FUNNELS FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE VALUE**


## LADDER

## FUNNEL #4:

## THE PERFECT WEBINAR

Webinars have become extremely popular sales tools over the past few
years, mainly because they work so well. They take the old
teleseminar/speaking model to a whole new

level. Back when I was doing a lot of speaking from the stage, my main
income came from all the products and coaching I sold after a presentation
was over. This is called

“back of the room” selling because there was always a table set up at the
back of the room where participants could go to buy whatever product I was
promoting. That model works

really well, but your sales are limited by the number of participants in the
room. There may be hundreds or thousands of people who would love to
buy your product, but for whatever reason, they aren’t at that seminar.
Webinars change that dynamic completely.

With a webinar, you can deliver your presentation online. People don’t have
to travel anywhere to catch your speech (and you don’t have to travel
anywhere either).


At its most basic level, a webinar is nothing more than a PowerPoint
presentation that

you broadcast live (or record) over the Internet. It allows you to give your
sales presentation to just about anyone in any corner of the globe. The best
part is you can record the webinar once and then broadcast it over and over
again. This is called an

“automated webinar,” and it’s made me a fortune over the years. Webinars
can be as long

as you want. In fact, you’ll learn about the Invisible Funnel Webinar in the
next chapter—

that one can be as long as four hours! The Perfect Webinar we’re discussing
in this chapter typically runs for about sixty to ninety minutes.

There are two parts to most webinars: the content and the sales pitch.
Occasionally, you may want to give an all-content webinar, but for the most
part, you’ll be selling something at the end of your presentation. You
promise to teach people something on the

webinar. Then, if they want to learn more or dive deeper into the topic, they
can purchase your product or sign up for coaching (or whatever you’re
selling). It’s very important that the content of the webinar is valuable on its
own, but as you’ll see from the Perfect Webinar script, you can craft the
material in a way that also helps to set up the sale. In this chapter, we’re


going to cover the sales funnels for both a one-time webinar and also for
automated (or evergreen) webinar.

**SALES WEBINAR FUNNEL**

The funnel for a sales webinar is very simple. You drive traffic to a
registration page where you have some sort of sales letter or video
encouraging readers to sign up for the

webinar. Typically I use the Who, What, Why, How script on my webinar
registration pages. After watching the video or reading the copy, the
interested prospects fill in their name and email to register. (Boom! They’re
now on your list.) Then you send them to a

confirmation page where they are reminded of the date and time of the
webinar and given

instructions on how to call in. At the appointed time, they will attend the
webinar, and you can sell them your product. Often people can’t make it to
the live webinar for some reason. So you may decide to send a recording.
After all, the more people who hear your

pitch, the more products you’re likely to sell.

**AUTOMATED WEBINAR FUNNEL**

Typically I will do a webinar live once, and then I take the recording from
that event and build out an Automated Webinar Funnel that will allow me to
keep sending traffic to that

website every day for the rest of my life. It’s nice because you can keep
selling your products twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, in every
country in the world! At the time of this writing, I currently have two
webinars that have both made me over a million

dollars. Both are still selling to people right now while I’m writing this
book!


We add a few extra steps to the regular Sales Webinar Funnel to make this
one run continuously. You start by driving traffic to a registration page that
uses the Who, What, Why, How script, and people enter their names and
emails to register. Then they go to a

confirmation page where they get the date and time, set for some point in
the future, or

they can choose to watch “yesterday’s” replay right away.

The webinar itself is the same format as the regular sales webinar; we
deliver content

and sell something at the end. (In a few pages, I’ll give you the Perfect
Webinar script, which will show you exactly how to do this.)

My team carefully tracks when a participant leaves, and then we send out a
different

email sequence, depending on how long they watched. Everyone who
subscribes gets one


sequence. Everyone who shows up and stays all the way to the end gets
another sequence.

People who show up but leave early get yet another sequence. And the no-
shows get an

entirely different sequence to encourage them to go back and watch a
replay. Each sequence encourages people to either go back and finish
watching, or go order the product

we’re selling. Once the participant places an order, the email sequences
should stop automatically.

**THE PERFECT WEBINAR SCRIPT**

Now that you have people signed up, what are you going to say? How you
structure your

webinar has everything to do with how much you sell at the end.

A typical webinar is broken down into three sections: the introduction, the
content, and the close (or the sales pitch). Over the past ten years, I’ve had a
chance to speak and sell on stages all around the world, and I’ve had the
chance to learn from some of the best stage closers in the world. This script
incorporates strategies I learned from at least a dozen different people. It’s
the outline I now use for every webinar, and it works.

There are a lot of pieces to this script, but try not to get overwhelmed.
Think of it as

just three sections—introduction, content, and the stack— then fill those
three sections in with the scripts provided.

**INTRODUCTION:** This should take about five minutes. It introduces you,
your subject, and your credibility.

_Hi, I’m Russell Brunson, founder of DotComSecrets and CEO of several
multi-million-dollar companies._


**Big Promise:** Repeat your big promise. This is the One Thing that got the
participants to sign up in the first place. It’s also the ruler they will use to
judge your webinar’s quality.

If you don’t set this ruler, then they will measure the value of your webinar
based on something outside of your control.

_In the next sixty minutes, you are going to learn my exact strategy on “how
to __________, without ____________. “_

**Hook to End:** Give the participants a reason to stick around all the way to
the end of the webinar. Free giveaways are popular. You could also promise
to do something funny

or show them something cool.

_Don’t forget! At the end of the webinar, I’m going to give you a secret link
where_

_you can download a transcript of everything I’m going to show you today.
You have to_

_be watching live in order to get this, so stick around. I promise it will be
worth your time._

**Command Attention:** Tell them to close out of Facebook, turn off their
cell phones,

and give you their undivided attention. Also, you might ask the participants
to grab a pen and paper for taking notes.

_I know there are distractions all around us, but this strategy I’m about to
share can change your life. I don’t want you to miss a single crucial step.
So, please ... make a commitment to stay focused. Can you do that for
yourself? Close out of Facebook._

_Stop checking your email. Turn off your cell phone. Give me your complete
attention._


**Qualify Yourself:** Let the participants know why you are qualified to speak
on the subject.

_You’re probably wondering why I’m qualified to teach on this topic. Here’s
my story: _____________._

**Future Pace:** Lead the viewers through some imagination exercises where
they can picture what life could be like once they learn the secrets you’re
about to reveal. Be descriptive and appeal to all five senses, if possible.

_Imagine what your life will be like after you know how to_

_Can you see ___________? Would that make things better for you?_

**THE CONTENT:** This is the meat of the webinar. It should run about fifty
to sixty

minutes, and it should deliver whatever content you promised in the
registration script. I like to focus on one main idea and then reveal three
secrets about that One Thing. So, I’m really teaching three things, but they
all relate to the main idea I’m selling.

**The One Thing:** The One Thing is the core content of this webinar. It’s the
reason the participants showed up. What do they want or need to learn or
understand? Every teaching

point through the webinar must point back to THIS one thing. I always try
to break down

my “One Thing” into this simple format:

How to ________without ___________.

_How to add high-ticket sales to your sales funnel instantly— without you_

_personally talking to anyone on the phone ... ever!_

This is the One Thing from my High-Ticket Secrets Webinar. For this offer,
I looked


at what the other “gurus” were teaching about making high-ticket sales.
They were all teaching how to close people on the phone. Well, I HATE
talking on the phone, and I think

most of my audience does, too. So, I decided to show people how they can
still take advantage of the income-boosting potential of high-ticket sales
_without_ talking on the phone.

After I explain this big idea—the One Thing—I share three secrets that will
expand

on what I promised to reveal. Typically, when I’m creating these three
secrets, I’m looking to debunk existing beliefs participants might have that
would keep them from purchasing

the product from me at the end of the webinar.

For my High-Ticket Secrets Webinar, there were three belief patterns that I
had to break in order to get people to buy. Below are the common beliefs
and then the secrets I

created to destroy that line of thinking:

**SECRET #1**

Break: _The best model for making money online is to sell products._

Rebuild: _You can make more money in one day selling high-ticket products
than you_

_can in a MONTH by selling normal products._

**SECRET #2**

Break: _To sell high-ticket products, I have to sell on the phone._

Rebuild: _You don’t personally have to sell anything! (Big plus because I
hate phones!) Let me show you how to build a two-person, mini call center
to close all of the sales for you._


## SECRET #3

Break: _It probably costs a fortune to drive enough traffic to make this work._

Rebuild: _You only need a little bit of traffic to make this work (about one
hundred clicks a day)._

Remember, teaching these three secrets should take fifty to sixty minutes.
So be sure

to tell stories, show examples, and use this as an opportunity to get your
audience to bond with the Attractive Character.

**THE STACK:** This section of the webinar should last at least ten minutes.
Often, I

allow for twenty minutes or more, depending on what I’m selling. The
hardest part of selling on a webinar, for most people, is transitioning into
the close. They start to get nervous, and the hesitation shows in the voice
and confidence level. The best way I’ve found to transition is simply to say,
_Let me ask you a question ...,_ and then you move straight into how your
product will help the participants with whatever your One Thing is.

Once you transition into your sales pitch, you’re going to use something
called “The Stack.”

**The Stack:** I consider The Stack my secret weapon. I learned it from one of
my mentors, Armand Morin. I saw him speak on stage and close nearly half
the room with almost no effort. I pulled him aside to find out what he was
doing, and he explained to me The Stack. I started using it immediately, and
I went from closing on average 5-10% of a

room to consistently closing 20% or more. Then I started using it on my
sales webinars and saw a dramatic increase in how much I made with each
viewing. It’s worked so well

and so consistently that I will never give a sales presentation again without
it.


Armand taught me that the only thing your prospect remembers when you
sell is the

last thing you showed him. He explained that most sales presentations focus
on the core

offer, then a list of bonuses. So the last thing shown is the last bonus,
followed by a call to action to get the prospect to buy. The problem with
this is when the person doesn’t think

that the _last thing_ you offered is worth the price. They simply won’t buy
under those circumstances.

So, Armand builds a presentation slide called a Stack Slide. This slide has
everything

included in the offer, presented in a long, bulleted list. He introduces the
first bullet point, talks about it, moves to the second bullet point, and so on.
But when he shows the slide

with the second bullet, he re-stacks the offer:

_So what that means is that you’re first going to get _________and also
_______._

He then talks about the next component of the offer and reveals the next
stack slide,

but this time, there are three products listed in the offer, stacked from the
first mentioned to the last. Be sure to notice the order and arrangement:

_So what that means is that you’re first going to get __________and_

_also_______AND also this _______._

He keeps doing this throughout the entire close. When he gets to that last
part of the


offer, he shows the final stack slide, with EVERYTHING listed, and recaps
everything on

that slide. Then, he finally introduces the price. Now, prospects associate
the price with the full offer—not just the last thing he mentions.

After you reveal your full stack slide, you want to show the total value of
everything

the buyers are going to receive. Even though the price you name first isn’t
what buyers will actually pay, you need to anchor that price in their minds
before you move on. We do

that by introducing “If all” statements similar to the ones we used in the
Star, Story, Solution script.

**If/All:** Use the words “If all” to anchor the offer and help the buyer justify
the price

you have given. Use both “toward pleasure” and “away from pain”
statements.

_If all this did was give you the house of your dreams, would it be worth it?_

_(Toward pleasure.)_

_If all this did was let you fire your boss, would it be worth it? (Away from
pain.)_

**Reveal the Real Price:** Now tell them the actual price. This price should be
much lower than the price you gave after The Stack.

_I’m not going to charge you ___________. I’m only going to charge you_

____________._

Those are all the core elements of a Perfect Webinar. It’s the path I take my
customers


down when I am selling them anything on a webinar. I do have a variety of
ways I close

out a webinar. As you can see from the image at the beginning of this
chapter, there are

sixteen methods that I use in most of my presentations. In order to make
these clear to you, I created a special video demonstrating how to use the
sixteen closes while you are

doing

The

Stack.

Now that you know the structure of the Perfect Webinar, how would you
like to learn

how to get people to _pay you to sell them_ highticket offers? We’ve
developed a special webinar funnel where people will pay you for the
privilege of letting you sell them on your highest-priced offerings. And
they’ll do it with smiles on their faces. It’s called the Invisible Funnel
Webinar, and it’s next!


## FUNNEL #5:

## INVISIBLE FUNNEL WEBINAR

The next way we sell products in the middle of the Value Ladder is through
a concept we

call the Invisible Funnel. The Invisible Funnel is a concept that was created
by Daegan Smith. It’s a powerful tool my team has used often over the past
few years to get people to ascend our Value Ladder quickly.

The Invisible Funnel is a premium webinar that people pay for AFTER the
webinar is

over—if (and only if) they love what you taught them. Let’s look at how it
works.

We drive traffic to a website that uses The Magic Bullet script to get people
to sign up

for the Invisible Funnel-style webinar. To register, participants enter their
credit card details, but they are not billed anything right then. They watch
the webinar, which is usually three or four hours of amazing, high-value
content. Then, AFTER the webinar is


over, _if_ they agree that the webinar was worth the pre-determined price,
then they do nothing, and you charge the card the next day. If the
participants don’t think the webinar was worth the money, they must send
you an email before a certain deadline so that you

won’t charge their card. This format lets people try before they buy, and it
gives you a chance to show off your very best content first.

At the end of the webinar, you can do a very soft sale to push the
participants to an

application page where they can upgrade to your high-ticket backend
products or services.

If you structure your Invisible Funnel correctly, you’ll find that it’s a really
cool way to get people to buy things—without ever _selling_ them anything.
It creates tons of good will and

builds a strong bond with the Attractive Character.

Let’s talk about the numbers from my first Invisible Funnel Webinar.

We had five hundred and fifty people register with their credit cards.

From those five hundred and fifty people, 85% of them showed up for the
actual webinar. (This number was shocking, considering that roughly 30%


attendance is common

on free webinars.)

I taught for four hours. At the end, I told those who didn’t love it to let me
know, and

I promised not to charge their credit cards.

From that offer, we only had about 10% of the people cancel. So we were
able to bill

90% of them the forty-seven dollar price tag, totaling about $23.5K. That’s
not bad, considering I hadn’t sold anything to anyone yet. I just gave them a
bunch of cool value in the form of information.

Finally, I invited those on the webinar to apply for my high-end coaching
services, and from that offer, we got a stack of applications that turned into
an additional six figures in business over the next thirty days.

We’ve successfully used the Invisible Funnel to sell weight-loss products,
dating advice, speed-reading programs, and a whole bunch more. I don’t
use the Invisible Funnel

for every selling situation, but it’s a powerful tool that my team uses a few
times each year to build a ton of good will with our audience—and to make
some extra money while we

do it.

Let me show you exactly how to get people to register for an Invisible
Funnel Webinar.

**MAGIC BULLET WEBINAR REGISTRATION SCRIPT**

A “Magic Bullet” is simply the One Thing you’re promising they’ll get out
of the webinar within a certain amount of time, or they don’t pay. There’s
an old saying in direct response marketing that you have to “sell it, even if


it’s free.” That goes for these “try before you buy” webinars, too. I do have
a script that I use to get people to pull out their

credit cards and sign up. For a video sales letter, this script should be
somewhere between two and three minutes—not too long.

**Raise the Question:** Set up your Magic Bullet by asking questions that
bring people’s desires to the front of their minds. Make them wish they had
what you’re about to offer.

You want the answers to the questions to be YES! Raising desire questions
at the beginning of the sales letter works really well. Depending on your
market, you may want

to use questions that move people toward pleasure or away from pain.

Example dialogue to move the participant toward pleasure:

_What if you could plug any book into your brain, instantly download that_

_knowledge, and implement that information into your life?_

_Do you want to learn a new language?_

_Do you desire to learn how to make money?_

_Are you ready to score high on a test?_

Example dialogue for moving a participant away from pain:

_Let me ask you a question ..._

_Do you ever feel like you’re the only guy in the world who can’t talk to a
pretty girl?_

_Do your hands start to sweat when you walk into a room full of people?_

_Does your heart beat so fast it feels like it might burst out of your chest
right then and there?_


_Does the thought of humiliation keep you home at night ... all alone?_

The final question should say something like, “Wouldn’t it be nice if ...,” or

“Wouldn’t it be awesome if ...”.

_Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a way to learn anything almost instantly
AND retain_

_it all much longer?_

_Wouldn’t it be great if you could walk into any social situation and feel
totally at ease?_

_Wouldn’t it be awesome if you could eat whatever you wanted every day and
still lose_

_weight?_

**Introduction:** Next you want to introduce yourself and the idea of the
Magic Bullet

you are going to offer in the webinar training.

_Hi, my name is Russell, and those are questions I used to ask myself as well._

_Just imagine if you had that ability. What would you learn? What
information would_

_you want if you could instantly download it into your brain?_

**Point out Frustrations:** Your prospects have probably tried other solutions
and failed. You need to let them know their frustrations are normal, and that
you once had

them, too. Don’t tell them what their frustrations are directly. Instead,
explain _your_ frustrations because they are likely the same things they are
struggling with.


_Unfortunately, gaining knowledge isn’t as easy as inserting a socket into
our brains to download the information._

_We have to find a good one to two hours if we want to open a book and sit
down to_

_read. Even if we read quickly, it’s going to take days to get the information
we need out of the book._

_While you might try using the Internet to speed up the process, you can
quickly become bogged down with millions of pages of listings for any topic
you want to study._

_Talk about “information overload”..._

_If you’ve ever felt that frustration with learning a new topic, then I can
relate to you perfectly._

**My Magic Bullet:** Now you introduce the amazing solution you’re selling.
Tell perspective participants about the tangible thing they’re going to get by
attending the webinar. If you get your Magic Bullet right, the rest of the sale
is very easy. So take some time to craft the best Magic Bullet Solution your
business can offer. For clarity, I try to phrase it like this: _You’ll get
___________(result) by ___________(short amount of time), or you pay
nothing._ The more tangible the result, the better.

You also want to describe how you discovered the solution and what the
value of that

solution has been to you. How did this secret change your life? What was
the emotional

value for you? A Magic Bullet in the dating niche might be “Get a
girlfriend this weekend

—or pay nothing.” A weight-loss example might be something like, “Try
my three-day detox and lose seven pounds, or you don’t pay anything.” The


Magic Bullet for speed reading might be: “Double your reading speed in
four hours—or pay nothing.” To draw in

the most participants, expand the main idea of your Magic Bullet and tell
the reader a story about how this solution has worked for you:

_Just like you, I struggled with reading—until I found the secret. I met this
guy named Howard Berg at a seminar. He spent just a few short hours with
me, and I was_

_able almost INSTANTLY to double how fast I could read! I started telling
my friends,_

_family members, and business associates about what Howard did at my
office; what happened next shocked me. Some people were BEGGING me to
meet him so they could double their reading speed ... Others were really
skeptical that it was even possible ..._

_So I gave them a challenge ... the SAME challenge that I’m going to give to
you_

_right now. Pay Howie one hundred dollars, and I guarantee that he’ll
MORE than double your reading speed in an afternoon ... and from that
point forward, for the rest_

_of your life, you’ll have a skill that will serve you forever._

**Don’t Worry (Proof):** Now you’re going to introduce the fact that you are
offering a premium webinar. You’ll also tell the participants not to worry
because you’re going to prove its worth before you charge them any money.

_And if you’re skeptical ... then don’t worry. Keep the hundred dollars in
your pocket, and then AFTER he’s personally trained you and you’ve
doubled your reading_

_speed ... then pay him the hundred._

_AND ... if he isn’t able to double your reading ... don’t pay him anything.
Does that seem fair? We called this the “Howard Berg, Double-Your-Speed_


_Challenge”._

_And so far ... Howard has NEVER lost. So, I set up a special webinar event
this_

_week for YOU and Howard Berg ..._

_If you are on this webinar ... Howard will double your reading speed and
prove_

_his amazing results to you ..._

**Risk Reversal (0** — **> $$):** Here’s where you offer the “try before you buy”
option.

_Here’s what I want to do for you: I’m so sure this will completely change
your life_

_that I’m going to let you listen to the entire webinar for FREE. Then, at the
end, you get to be the judge. Either I live up to my word or I don’t._

_If I do deliver what I promise and you love the information, do nothing and
we’ll_

_charge your credit card one hundred dollars._

_If I don’t deliver, or you don’t think the information was worth the price, just
send_

_me an email before midnight, and we won’t charge you anything._

_Does that sound fair?_

_It’s kind of like going to a restaurant and only paying if you love the food._

_Or going to a movie, and if you hate it ... then you pay NOTHING ..._

**The Close:** Get the reader to commit to giving your webinar a try.


_So, now it’s your turn to decide._

_Say yes, and let us prove that our system works._

_You will need to put your credit card number in now to reserve your spot,
but you_

_pay NOTHING until after the webinar is over, and then pay only if you love
it._

_You’ve got nothing to lose by giving this a try._

_If there’s even a chance that this could completely change your life ...isn’t it
worth_

_checking it out for free?_

_Just click the button below, and reserve your spot for this life-changing
webinar. I_

_promise it will be worth it._

This Magic Bullet script is pretty simple, and I can usually write up one of
these sales

letters in less than an hour. If you follow this script, swapping out the
reading program for the details of your training, you should be able to get it
done quickly—even if you hate writing sales letters. This script is proven to
work. Just tweak it to fit your business and your offer. And remember, once
you get your Magic Bullet right, everything else should

come together with ease.


Now that you’ve got people signed up for your webinar, what the heck do
you say for

two to four hours? I know providing value for that long might sound
intimidating, but you

can do it! Let’s dive into the script I use for all our Invisible Webinars.

**INVISIBLE WEBINAR CONTENT**

Once you have participants signed up for your webinar, you still have some
work to do.


It’s important to structure the webinar correctly so that all who watch feel
like they’ve gotten their money’s worth. You want each participant to be
more than happy to pay you at

the end. You also want to use the correct lead up and soft sales pitch for
your high-ticket consulting or coaching package at the end of the webinar.
Remember, this webinar is going to be three or four hours long! So you
may need to bring in multiple pieces of content. Don’t hold anything back.
Give viewers your best stuff! Tell them everything they want to know.
Answer any questions they ask. Trust me, the four hours will go by before

you know it.

Here’s how to structure your Invisible Funnel Webinar:

**Re-tell Hook:** You got the participants to register for this webinar by using
your Magic Bullet script (the “try before you buy” hook), so you need to
reinforce the rules they are playing by during this webinar. They get a
chance to vote with their wallet at the

end: did the webinar deliver or not? And remind them they must stick
around until the end because only then will you give the secret email
address where they can email you if they

don’t think the webinar was worth the price of admission.

**Tell Them What They’ll Learn:** Give all participants an overview of the
system that

you are going to be teaching on this particular webinar.

**Content (for each content piece):** Start teaching your content now. It
doesn’t really matter how many pieces you teach—as long as it’s your best
stuff and it fills up the three or four hours you promised. You may want to
practice teaching the content pieces out loud

so that you know how much time to budget during the actual webinar.
Here’s how you want to present each content piece:


## •

**What Is It?** Give the content piece a cool name, making it easy to
remember.

-

**Parable:** Tell a memorable story to demonstrate the concept and cement it
in the

participant’s brain.

-

**Teach Concept:** Go through the nuts and bolts of the concept.

-

**Example (real life, if possible):** Give some examples of how the concept
works

in real life. If you have case studies that show your students or clients

succeeding, those are the best examples.

**Recap:** After you have finished teaching the content for your training, then
you want to remind them again about everything they learned while they
were on the training with

you.

**Tie It to Value:** Help participants see how much this information will be
worth after they implement it. After you have anchored the “true-worth”
price in their minds, then you can come back to the actual asking price of
this webinar. How much money will they make after they implement all
they learned? How much time could they save? What’s the

emotional value of the knowledge they gained? Will it save them
embarrassment or grief?


Lay out all the benefits for them.

**Was It Worth $__to You?** Ask the participant to decide whether the
webinar was worth this price.

-

**If so:** Do nothing, and we will bill your credit card the agreed-upon price.

-

**If not:** Email us at ___________before__________, and let us know this

content wasn’t for you, and we won’t charge your card.

**Transition to Offer:** Briefly mention that the participant may now want
personalized help.

_I know we’ve covered a TON of information today, and some of you are
probably_

_wishing you could get some help with setting all this up. Am I right?
Quickly, I want to let you know that I do have a personal coaching
program. It’s not cheap because you_

_get my personal attention the whole way through the process, but I make
sure you have_

_everything you need to be successful. Also, because I’m personally involved
and work_

_very closely with my students, I can only help a limited number of people.
So, the only_

_way to get in is to apply for a slot. You’ve received everything you need to
succeed in this webinar, but if you are interested in getting my personal
help, here’s what you should do next ..._

**Pick Your Close:** Where will you send people to fill out an application?


## •

**To Website:** Give the URL where a participant can pay for your coaching.

- **Free Application:** If this is a free application, make clear that there is no

charge to apply.

-

**Paid Application:** If you’re charging participants to apply, let them know
how

much and how they should pay.

**Simple, Three-Step Close:** This is a very soft sell. You want to let people
know that you do offer personal coaching or consulting to help them get the
best results as fast as possible. Then tell them where to go to fill out an
application.

-

**What:** Tell them what your service consists of.

-

**Why:** Tell them why they should apply.

-

**How:** Tell them how to apply.

**Let’s Review:** Invisible Webinars are a great way to get people into your
Value Ladder for free and build a relationship between them and the
Attractive Character. Be sure to build in so much value that you can quickly
ascend the viewer to your highest levels. Webinars can accomplish all this
in a way that is fun for the participant. I’ve made hundreds of thousands of
dollars using this style of teaching, and people just love it. The keys to


making it work are having the right Magic Bullet (promising a result they’ll
get _before_ they pay) and delivering what you promised.

**Up Next:** Do you have a new product, but aren’t sure how to launch it into
the world?

The next chapter will show you our Product Launch Funnel and provide the
scripts we use

for each step.

## FUNNEL #6:

## PRODUCT LAUNCH

The Product Launch Funnel was made famous by Jeff Walker, and since
then, just about

every Internet marketer in almost every niche has used this funnel in some
way—because

the approach works. Basically, you’re breaking up your sales presentation
over four videos

—each providing a ton of value, while educating your prospects and selling
your products.


This funnel works best with warm and hot traffic. So, typically you’re
emailing your own

list or an affiliate partner’s list with links to the videos.

This Product Launch Funnel is broken down into four videos:

Video #1 is called “Wow and How,” where you will “wow” them with a big
idea, and

then show them “how” you and others are using this concept.

Video #2 is the “Transformational Education” piece, where you will
actually let people look over your shoulder as you walk through the process
with them.

Video #3 is the “Ownership Experience” piece, where you show viewers
what it’s like

to live when they have this in their lives.

Video #4 is “The Offer,” where you will reveal what you’re selling, the
price, and how they can get it.


Let’s take a look at how each of these videos is scripted to make sales. The
following

scripts will show you what to say in each video. The videos can be as long
as they need to be, but I find that the sweet spot is around ten to twenty
minutes.

**VIDEO #1: “WOW AND HOW”**

**Big Promise:** This is your One Thing, the valuable principle you have
promised to teach during these training videos.

_How to sell high-ticket products without getting on the phone._

**Kill Myths:** Dispel any common objections or reasons the potential
participant might not believe you.

You may think you have to be a sales expert and hang out on the phone all
day to sell

high-ticket products, but that’s not true anymore. I’ve sold hundreds of
thousands of dollars with this simple process.

**Let’s Look at Others (Content #1):** Show how others achieve these results
all the time. Tell stories and case studies.

_Meet __________. She did ________________, without_

_Here’s ___________. He couldn’t believe how easy it was to ___________.
Just look at his results: ____________.

**Hook to Video #2:** Get them excited about the next video.

_Tomorrow, you’ll discover you can ___________, even though
___________._

**VIDEO #2: “TRANSFORMATIONAL EDUCATION”**


**Let’s Do It Together:** It’s okay if you don’t think you can do it on your
own. Let’s go over it together now.

_I know it might be hard to believe you can ____________. So, I’m going to
show_

_you just how easy it really is. Let’s go over it together right now._

**How “I” Do It (Content #2):** Here’s how I do it, step by step (just give a
brief overview of the steps).

_Here’s exactly what I do every time:_

_Step 1:_

_Step 2:_

_Step 3:_

**Proof That It Works:** Show your successful results, case studies, or other
proof.

_Here’s how well it works for me ..._

_But don’t just take my word for it. Here’s what my students have done ..._

**Hook to Video #3:** Get them excited for the next video.

_Tomorrow, you’ll discover ___________._

**VIDEO #3: OWNERSHIP EXPERIENCE**

**Future Pace Experience:** Imagine what your life could be like if you
commit to this program.

_I want you to take a moment to imagine what would be different in your life
if ___________._

_What possibilities would open up for you if ___________?_


_How would you be different if ___________?_

**How “YOU” Do It (Content #3):** Imagine yourself doing this exact
process. Here’s

what it would look like.

_Now, imagine yourself doing ___________, then ___________, and finally_

____________._

_Can you see yourself doing this?_

_In your mind’s eye, it looks pretty simple, right?_

**Hinting to the Offer:** Would you like the chance to learn in the fastest,
easiest way possible?

_We all know reality is usually a little more complicated than our
imaginations. But_

_I know this will change your life, and I want to see you succeed. That’s why
I’m going_

_to help you ___________._

**Hook to Offer Video:** In the next video, I’ll show you how you can get
results just

like these.

_Tomorrow, I’m going to show you the fastest and easiest way to
___________._

_Your success is closer than you know._

**VIDEO #4: THE OFFER**

**Here’s What I’ve Got:** Explain the offer.


_I really want to see you succeed. I’ve been where you are, and I know how
hard it_

_can seem. That’s why I created_______________._

_Here’s what you get ..._

**Here’s What You’ll Do with It:** Explain how it works.

_Here’s how each piece helps you move forward ..._

**Here’s What It’ll Do for You:** Explain the results.

_When you follow the steps as I’ve outlined them, here’s what you can expect
..._

**Here’s What You Need to Do Right Now:** Explain how to order and what
to expect

next.

_Just click the button below, and you’ll be taken to a secure shopping page.
In just_

_three clicks from now, you’ll be on your way to ___________._

**Let’s Review:** Product Launch Funnels are best used with warm or hot
traffic. We usually send people to the videos from a link in an email—either
to our own list or to an

affiliate or JV partner’s list. You break down your sales presentations into
more digestible chunks, delivered over the course of a few days to build up
excitement. You teach in the

first three videos and then sell your product in the fourth.

**Up Next:** If you sell high-ticket coaching or consulting, you probably spend
a ton of time on the phone with tire kickers and people who really aren’t a
good fit for your offer.


Wouldn’t it be cool if you could just collect applications and pre-frame your
highticket consulting clients to say _yes_ before you even get on the phone
with them?

Better yet, what if you didn’t have to get on the phone with them at all, yet
could still

sell them on your offer? How cool would that be?

The secret is in the next chapter.

**BACKEND FUNNEL**

## FUNNEL #7:

## HIGH-TICKET, THREE-STEP APPLICATION

This funnel is a very simple process to qualify and pre-frame potential high-
ticket consulting or coaching clients. For years we called all of our buyers
and offered them coaching. The problem was it took sixty sales guys to
contact all of our buyers. It cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars a
month to weed through everyone and find the few who

were interested. A few years ago, we decided to close down the call center
and find a better way to sell our high-ticket coaching services. That’s when
this three-step application process was born. It has given us the ability to
make almost as much gross revenue without having huge overhead. We can


literally make as many sales with just two sales people as we could with
sixty! Let me tell you how it works.

**Step #1:** You need to create a simple page that shares a case study video
explaining the results your clients can get when they receive coaching from
you. After watching the

free case study video, potential clients click on the “apply now” button and
are taken to an application designed to pre-qualify them as good prospects.

**Step #2:** The prospects fill out a full application, which serves two
purposes. It helps your sales people learn about an applicant’s business—
where they are now and what their

business goals are for the future. More importantly, though, it pre-frames
the prospect by getting them to sell you on why you should take them on as
a coaching client. The application stage weeds out those who really aren’t
ready, so you are ONLY calling the prospects who are ready to start
working with you. The application also pre-sells the program in the
prospect’s mind. After they finish the application, we take them to a

“homework” page.


**Step #3:** The applicants follow the instructions on the homework page, all
the while building an even stronger bond with the Attractive Character. My
Inner Circle homework

page includes three videos for applicants to watch. The first video is a short
class with me teaching what it takes to succeed in this business. The second
video tells the story of how my wife and I struggled to start our family. It
explains exactly why I’m so passionate about helping business owners get
their messages out into the world. (It’s also a tear-jerker.) The third video is
a series of case studies and testimonials about the coaching program itself.


Fig 20.3a: The homework page is an important pre-frame step that helps
make

the final sale easier.

Another important function of the homework page is explaining what’s
going to

happen next (the applicants will be contacted by one of three sales people)
and offering a way to contact US by phone—if they just can’t wait. My
sales team is great at calling people quickly. But when people are in pain
NOW, they often want to feel like they’re being proactive. If someone is at
that hyperactive buyer stage, I don’t want them to have to wait for us to
call. So, I give them a way to call us.


The sales script for selling the high-ticket item on the phone is pretty long
and involved. Let’s dive in and look at our script for selling high-ticket
products.

**HIGH-TICKET, TWO-STEP SCRIPT**

Closing a high-end client takes more time and finesse than selling a simpler
product. It’s important to change the selling environment to a phone
conversation; a live event or seminar environment could also work. Most
prospects won’t whip out a credit card and pay twenty-five thousand dollars
based on a video sales letter alone. We have a very effective, high-end sales
process, and I’m going to share the script with you here. It’s much more
involved than the other scripts we’ve covered in this book so far. In fact, the

entire process can take from seventy-five minutes to two hours. If you’re
interested in learning the finer points and details involved in selling with
this process, you can learn more at [http://www.highticketsecrets.com.](http://www.highticketsecrets.com.)

My team uses a two-step script because it’s really the most effective way to
close a

high-end ticket sale over the phone. You will need two different people to
make a sale using this process: the setter and the closer. Using two sales
people provides consistency in your sales. When you find the right people


and they follow the script, it works, day in and day out. You should not be
the one selling directly on the phone; you’re too close to

the outcome emotionally, and it’s just bad positioning.

Instead, two sales people work together to close a new client. The setter
gathers basic

information on the prospect, draws out his emotions, and identifies the
prospect’s pain and goals. Once that is done, the setter gets off the phone
and has the closer call the applicant back. The closer magnifies the pain,
gets the prospect to sell himself on why he is a good fit for the program, and
then provides the solution.

**THE SET SCRIPT**

**Introduction:** For setters, the goal here is to introduce themselves in a low-
key way and have a natural conversation with the prospect. The setter is
getting to know the prospect

and pulling out any emotions related to the topic you’re discussing. They
must find out where the prospect is right now and _how he feels_ about where
he is.

**Questions:** Then the setter should focus on finding out where the prospect
wants to

be. What are his hopes and dreams? What’s the real reason, deep down, that
he wants those things? He may want to make a hundred thousand a year—
that’s great. But why?

What would that money allow him to do? Quit his current job? Stay home
with his kids?

Buy a boat and sail around the world? Buy his aging parents a home?
Finally show his ex-

wife that he’s worth something after all? The setter has to find out the _why._
That’s where you’ll find the emotions. Remember, people buy based on


emotion first, then they rationalize the decision with logic.

You’ve probably heard sales advice saying you need to get to a buyer’s
emotions, but

I find many people just don’t know how to do that. You hook the emotions
by asking questions. Always ask additional questions. Does the prospect
have kids? Great! How old

are they? What are their names? If you know the prospect wants to
homeschool his kids,

ask why. How would it feel to know he had the freedom to teach his kids
any way he wanted? Follow-up questions help you hook into emotions.
What would it mean to the prospect if he could buy that new house for his
parents? How would he feel standing on a

boat in the Caribbean, totally free of debt and worry? Help the prospect
paint a picture of the _feelings_ behind his dreams. You can get all this
information with a few questions; within five minutes, the setter knows
exactly why the prospect is going to buy this program. He also knows the
hot buttons to focus on.

The setter should ask the prospect, “What’s holding you back? Why haven’t
you

achieved your dreams already?” You’ll probably hear some variation of _I
don’t know how._

The prospect doesn’t know how to build a business online. Or, he may say
he doesn’t have

time—which is really saying he doesn’t know how to build a business in
five hours a week. He may say it is because he doesn’t have money—which
is really saying he doesn’t

know how to build a business using other people’s money. Once the
prospect realizes it’s


simply a lack of knowledge blocking his success—and that you can provide
him with that

knowledge—ask him this question: _If you knew how to build a business in
just five hours a week, would you do it?_ Of course, he is going to say yes!
He has just started to sell himself on purchasing your product, your
knowledge.

The setter cannot move forward with the script until he understands the
prospect’s emotional hot buttons. The prospect must also admit he doesn’t
know what he is doing (in

some form or another) when it comes to building a business. He must
realize he needs help.

**Blast: Give Him a Taste of What You Offer:** Don’t go into great detail
about the program; that’s what he’s buying. But the setter should give him
an idea of what he could

discover or get done.

_Now, obviously, it’s impossible to work with everyone who applies/buys our_

_information ... so I’m here to weed out those who aren’t ready and find the
right people to work with one-on-one. I understand you don’t know how to
build a business_

_in five hours a week. And I don’t know, but maybe we can help. Let me
explain what we_

_do here ..._

Next, ask a critical question to get the prospect to sell himself. Use a pivotal
question

that will bring home all the reasons he needs to pull out his credit card at
the end of the conversation.


_Let me ask you this ... if you could work one-on-one with Russell Brunson
or someone like him ... do you think you’d be successful?_

_(Absolutely!)_

_How come?_

Here’s why this is so important: I can talk for hours about how great our
program is

and all the reasons the prospect should buy ... but it might be a lie. If HE
tells me all the reasons he’d be successful with our program ... then it’s the
truth because he believes it.

When the setter gets him to explain all the reasons he’d be successful, sales
become easy.

Ask: _How come? Why would working with Russell Brunson help you be_

_successful?_

Then, the setter must shut up! Don’t talk. Let the prospect talk.

Once he gives the reasons, the setter should repeat them back and confirm
his beliefs.

_So, if I gave you the chance to work with Russell Brunson, you believe
you’d be_

_successful? (Yes!)_

_If you had the opportunity to work with Russell Brunson, you could get (fill
in what they want)?_

_If you had the opportunity to work with Russell Brunson, you’d know how
to get_

_there?_


_Next, get the prospect to sell himself and tell the setter why you should work
with_

_him._

_Why do you think you’d be a good candidate for this program?_

**Posture:** To set up the closer as the expert, the setter should say the
following:

_Now, I’m not personally an expert at building businesses online in five
hours a week. My job is simply to find the people who are qualified to be
part of this program._

_If I feel good about you, I’ll turn you over to our Program Director_ (the
closer). _He is the one to decide who will be the right fit for our program._

_Before I do that, I need to find out a little more about you and fill out a
short profile. I need to understand where you are right now professionally
and financially._

_Then I need to find out more specifics about where you want to be in the
future. All this information will help us determine if you’re going to be a
good candidate._

_Is it alright if I ask you a few questions?_

_(Sure ...)_

The setter has just asked for (and gotten) permission to ask just about
anything.

**Probe: Collect Financial Information:** Your setter is going to start asking
some pretty personal questions next and is going to fill out a form with the
information. You want people to answer quickly, without getting too
emotional. Start by asking about age,

marital status, highest level of education, and things like that.


Then the setter must be sure to ask, _Is there anyone else involved in your
business—a spouse or financial partner?_ If so, get the other party on the
phone, too, right then and there. It’s a waste of time to keep going through
the presentation if you don’t have all the decision makers present.

The goal of this next set of questions is to find out the prospect’s financial
status and

whether you really can help.

**Finding Credit:** Your setter is going to find out details about the prospect’s
credit situation.

_How would you rate your credit right now? Why?_

_If Russell Brunson were to write a check and pay off all your debt, how
much would_

_that be?_

_Of that debt, how much is major credit card debt?_

_What’s the total amount of combined credit that’s been extended to you?_
(Subtract total debt from combined credit extended, and you find out how
much he has available.)

You’re looking for more available credit than the program costs. It’s also
helpful to get him to talk about his credit balances to show that you’re
really trying to help pay those off—not add to them. The prospect might
need to take one step back to take ten steps forward, but ultimately we
know a program like this can help him pay off all the debt and

achieve financial freedom.

The setter should also ask if the prospect has any savings accounts or
investments.

Does he own his own home or rent? What about retirement accounts?


**Goals: Talking About a Prospect’s Short-Term Goals:** Your setter is still
asking questions and getting the prospect to sell himself on the program.

_What would be an optimal situation in six months? Where would you want
your business in six months?_

_How long have you been trying to do ______________? How successful
have you been?_

_In twelve months, where do you want to be? What would make you feel
good?_

_So, in working one-on-one with Russell Brunson ... do you think you could_

_achieve these goals? Can you see yourself achieving them? How come?_

**Commitments: Get Four Commitments:** Now the setter is getting the
prospect to declare himself a good candidate. He is publicly stating he is the
kind of person who takes action and finishes what he starts. Once he does
this, his brain will have a really hard time reversing that declaration and
talking himself out of the purchase.

_You look like a potential candidate for me to recommend to my director.
Before I_

_can make the recommendation and turn you over to him, there are four
commitments_

_that must be agreeable to you._

_1. You must have a minimum time commitment of ___________ per week.
Can you do that?
2. We need people who are coachable and willing to learn and follow the
advice_

_of our experts. Can you do that? Why are you coachable?_


_3. We’re looking for people who can start today. We want quick decision
makers._

_When do you think is the best time to start working on ___________ (his
goals)?_

You want to hear some version of “right now.”

_Great. If it looks like this is a fit for both of us, is there anything that would
hold you back from getting started today?_

_4. We want to teach you the concept of using OPM (other people’s money)
to invest in ___________. Are you familiar with this idea? Would you like to
learn more_

_about it?_

Explain how to use the bank’s money (credit cards) as a short-term
leveraging tool to

invest in growing his business or reaching his goals.

_We have two levels in this program:________ and_ __________. (Lower
price and higher price.)

_How much are you comfortable investing to get your business started
today? Why_

_would you choose that amount?_

Now put him on hold while you go talk to your “director.” Discuss the
candidate with

the closer. If you feel like he would be a good fit for your program, and
someone you’d

like to work with, then come back to the call.


_Let me have you write down my director’s name; it’s ___________. I’m so
happy_

_he’s available to talk with you personally, because he is an expert at
___________._

_Most importantly, his job is to make sure we have the right kind of people
on our team._

_So, I want you to understand this is not for everybody. Please don’t be
offended if he doesn’t offer you a slot. Okay?_

_He’s in a meeting right now, but he said he’ll be happy to call you back in
five or_

_ten minutes._

_He wanted me to give you a little exercise to go through while you are
waiting. I_

_know we’ve talked about your goals, but he’d like you to write them down
for yourself._

_Write down a six- to twelve-month financial goal. Next, write down three
things you want besides money._

_Okay? Great! My director will call you shortly._

**THE CLOSE SCRIPT**

This script for the closer is very similar to the Set Script. You want to
reinforce the candidate’s decisions in his mind. The closer will go through
the same questions as in the

introduction, but perhaps worded a little differently. Get the candidate to
picture exactly what life will be like after he has success with your
program.

_Why are you serious about ___________ right now?_


_How long have you been thinking about ___________?_

_What’s the biggest thing that’s held you back from ____________?_

_What are you looking to do in six months? What would that do for you?_

_What are you hoping for in twelve months? What would that do for you?_

_How about in five years? What would your lifestyle be like?_

_Then you want the prospect to connect you with his dreams._

_If you have the chance to work with someone like Russell Brunson, how
would that make a difference in your life? Anything else?_

Next, the closer goes through the four commitments again.

_It’s my job to find only the very best people for this program. It’s not for
everybody, and I only want people on board if I know they have what it
takes to be successful. So I’m going to ask you a series of questions, and
these are things you’re either committed to or you’re not. So, they are
simple yes or no answers. Is that something you’re willing to do?_

Don’t move on if you’re not getting the answers you’re looking for. Either
back track

to find out why the prospect isn’t committed or get off the phone because he
is not a likely close.

**Time: Explain the Time Commitment**

_Are you able to commit to __________hours per week? (Yes or no.)_

**Decision Making: Explain the Decision Commitment**

_Opportunities don’t wait around. Making decisions is very important. Do
you see_


_anything that would hold you back from making a decision to work with
Russell Brunson today? (Yes or no.)_

**Resources: Investment Commitment**

_Write this number down: ___________________._

_Now, as long as you see the value, and the program meets all your goals, is
there_

_any reason you can think of that would keep you from investing
___________ today?_

_(Yes or no.)_

If the setter and the closer have done all the previous steps correctly and the
prospect

says you or your product/service is the next best thing to sliced bread, then
suddenly the price tag isn’t such a big deal anymore. It’s all about setting
things up in the beginning to keep him from objecting to the money at this
step.

**Knowledge: Teachability**

_My main concern with taking on students is that they are teachable. They
must be willing to learn and then implement what they’ve learned so they
are successful. Do you feel like you’re that kind of person? (Yes or no.)_

_How come?_

_So if someone could show you how to do ___________ , you would be
successful?_

_(Yes or no.)_

**What’s Included: What the Prospect Gets When He Signs Up Today**


_We’re going to give you everything you need to be successful and avoid
mistakes._

_Your coach will help you work at your own speed._

Now, simply list out exactly what buyers get with the product or program.

**Close: Finalizing the Sale**

_This is probably the most important question ..._

_Why do you feel like you are a good candidate for this program?_

The prospect is selling himself _again_ on how he will be successful if he is
accepted.

Then all that’s left to do is take his credit card information. Instead of you
asking for the sale, he is asking you to _let him_ buy. Do you see the subtle
distinction there?

Sales become easy when he tells you (or your setter/closer) why he needs
your help.

Okay, that’s the whole two-step script for the setter and the closer. Again, I
strongly

recommend you listen to this script in action to gain a better understanding
of each step.

Just go to [http://www.highticketsecrets.com.](http://www.highticketsecrets.com.)

**Let’s Review:** When selling high-ticket coaching and consulting programs,
it’s important to weed out people quickly if they aren’t going to be a good
fit. That way, you

can spend more time with the people you can really help. The application
and homework


pages pre-frame and pre-sell the prospect on all the reasons he should sign
up—instead of

worrying about all the reasons he shouldn’t sign up.

When there’s twenty-five, fifty, or a hundred thousand dollars on the line at
the end of

a sales call, you want to make sure you’re following a proven plan. The
most effective way I’ve found to close high-ticket sales is to hire two
commission-based sales people and have them use the two-step script
outlined in this chapter.

**Up Next:** Now that you have learned how all seven core funnels work and
the scripts

we use at each level, I want to show you how simple it can be to build out
these funnels. I am going to give you a quick tutorial on how to use
ClickFunnels.com to build out any funnel you can dream of.

## SECTION FIVE:

## CLICKFUNNELS


One of the first questions people ask me after they learn about my seven
core funnels is

this: _But, Russell, there’s so much technology involved ... how do I create
all the web pages and make sure they’re connected together correctly?_ I
don’t want technology to hold anyone back from building a more successful
business, so I want to officially introduce you to ClickFunnels. It can be
your new best friend and take care of most of the tech stuff for you.

This section is not meant to be a full tutorial on how to use ClickFunnels.
The first step I go through when creating any funnel is to decide which type
of funnel I’m going to

create. Is this a frontend funnel? Is it a middle-of-the-Value-Ladder funnel
or a backend funnel? After I know which type of funnel, then I decide
which one of the seven core funnels offers the best way to sell this product.

Then I usually get in front of a whiteboard and sketch out each of the steps
this funnel

will require. Remember the seven phases of a funnel and also the twenty-
three building blocks I explained? Am I going to use a quiz to pre-frame
this funnel, or just start with a squeeze page? What price will I set for my
frontend offer? Will I use an order form bump?

How many upsells will I have? Will I add any downsells if the customer
says no to one of

my upsells?

Next, I want to map out my follow-up sequence. Who is my Attractive
Character?

How do I want to flesh out that character in my emails? What will I say in
each email in

my Soap Opera Sequence? What types of messages do I want to send out in
my Seinfeld


emails?

I then sketch it out like this:

Fig 21.2: First, we draw out the flow of the funnel. Then we set everything
up with

a few clicks inside ClickFunnels.

After I have a visual representation of what I want to build, then I can log in
to

ClickFunnels.com and let the magic begin. We’ve made ClickFunnels easy
enough that a CEO could use it, but also powerful enough that your web
and tech guys will love it.

**Step #1:** Pick which type of funnel you want to build.


Fig 21.3: The first step in ClickFunnels is choosing what type of funnel you
want to

build.

**Step #2:** Choose which template you want to use at each step in the funnel,
or you can custom design your own templates from scratch. My team has
dozens of proven templates that we’ve perfected over the years for each of
these steps, so it would be hard to go wrong if you stick with these.

Fig 21.4: Step two is choose your web page template.

**Step #3:** After you’ve picked the template designs for each step, finalize the
funnel and you will be able to see your entire sales funnel at a glance.


Fig 21.5: Once you’ve finalized your funnel, the page templates are set up
and all

your analytics and stats are available on the dashboard.

**Step #4:** Now you can go in and edit the copy, add your videos, integrate
with your

email auto-responder, and set up your order forms on each page.

Fig 21.6: Text, video, buttons, order forms–all areas of the template are

customizable.


After that’s finished, you’ll see that the sales funnel you sketched out on the
whiteboard has now come to life. You can start driving traffic and getting
results in record time! Isn’t that exciting?! While this once took our team of
experts two to four weeks to

create, we can now create everything in ClickFunnels in about an hour!

week trial at

**CONCLUSION:**

**IGNITE**

Phew!

Right now you’re probably feeling a bit overwhelmed. This book is not
exactly what I

would consider light reading. You’ve just concluded a full-on immersion
course in high-

level Internet marketing strategy, and you should feel proud of yourself.

Being overwhelmed is actually a good thing because even though you feel
like all that

information is a big, jumbled MESS upstairs, your brain is subconsciously
making connections. Right now, without you consciously doing anything,
it’s figuring out which


competitors you might want to research. It’s strategizing about what your
Value Ladder will look like and what types of sales funnels you will use to
ascend people on your Value Ladder. All this is happening, even though you
might feel overwhelmed.

Pretty cool, huh?
