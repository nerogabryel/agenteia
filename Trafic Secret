### FOREWORD

“Twenty-five thousand dollars. Do I hear thirty?”
The voice of the auctioneer was fast, and the suspense built as the
bidding got higher and higher.

“Yes,” I said.
“Thirty thousand dollars from the black-haired gentlemen in the front.”
“Forty,” a voice behind me said.
“Forty thousand dollars from the man in the back.”
“Forty-five,” I said.
“Forty-five thousand dollars!”
I couldn’t see who was bidding against me, but when the auctioneer
finally arrived at $50,000, I decided to stop bidding.
To my surprise, so did the person behind me. The auctioneer yelled out,
“Number 27, you win the bid!”

I was Number 27. I won. I was bidding to name a commercial Virgin
Atlantic plane. Yes, I know that may sound pretentious, but it was for a
great cause.
About 12 years before writing this, I was at one of Richard Branson’s
charity events. I had met Richard several years earlier when a friend and I
raised a lot of money for his charity Virgin Unite.

At this charity event, I had decided I’d go all in. Richard was paying all
the bills for the charity, and 100 percent of the money we donated was
going to help those who needed it most.
Well, the gentleman three tables behind me had come to the same
conclusion—which is why it was going to cost me $50,000 to name a plane.

After I won the bid, Richard stood up and proclaimed, “Why fight over
it, boys? I’ll give it to both of you for fifty thousand dollars each! It’s all
going to charity!”


The person who walked up on stage with me (and who was bidding
against me) was a young man who looked 10 years younger than he actually
was.

His name was Russell Brunson.
It was the first time I had actually met him in person. What a charming
guy he was, there for the same reason as I was: to help people in need.

There were people in the room that day who were super famous, a lot
richer, and way more well known than both Russell and me. But he was the
guy who left a mark on me.
I didn’t really get to know Russell until a few years later, but when I did,
I realized he was one of the most humble, smart, ambitious, energetic, and
authentic human beings I’d ever met.

What most impressed me was how he talked about helping entrepreneurs
grow faster. He talked about them as if they were his children, and with an
authentic excitement.
That’s very rare in our world today.
Russell’s focus was never on how much money he was going to make or
how big his business was going to be. He always looked through the lens of
how to help people go faster.
He took that energy and passion and cofounded a company called
ClickFunnels, which has revolutionized the way people use the internet to
turn their ideas into sellable products and services. Russell has truly given
people a faster way to make an impact and profit from their ideas.

Russell’s passion drove ClickFunnels to become one of the fastest-
growing software as a service (SaaS) companies of all time, creating
massive impact on tens of thousands of lives around the world.
The overwhelming success people have gotten from using Russell’s
software and trainings is unprecedented.

**But that’s not the only reason you need to read this book.**
The global economy and how we consume products and information has
already changed drastically and will continue to evolve. Those who don’t
have the necessary skills and capabilities—to sell their products and
services, to market their brick-and-mortar company, or to create funnels that
brings customers to their doors—will be left behind.


I’m not saying that to scare you.
But understand, I’m not just taking a wild guess.
I see it coming, and I have the same passion Russell does. I’ve been
blessed to be in the self-education industry for over 22 years. I’m a multiple
_New York Times_ best-selling author, and I’ve been able to start 13
companies that have generated over a billion dollars in sales.

These opportunities have positioned me at the edge of this world, and I
can see the change coming.
Is there any worse feeling than being left behind? Russell Brunson’s
passion for helping you avoid that feeling is why he wrote this book, and
my shared passion is why I wrote this Foreword.

This book reveals the most cutting-edge way to drive eyeballs to your
product or service **to help people find you.**

There’s a classic movie with Kevin Costner called _Field of Dreams_.^1 It’s
about building a baseball stadium in the middle of nowhere. The movie is
great, but it sends a bad message that people will come simply by
something being built.
Unfortunately, too many people in business have taken the concept
literally and have decided to run their businesses that way. They think if
they build the best product or service, invent the best widget, create the best
mastermind, or write the best book, the world will just find it. They think
that as long as they build the best product or service, people will just show
up to buy it.

The reality is they won’t just come.
Unless people know that you exist and you give them a compelling
reason to come find you, they aren’t coming.

Without good marketing, your ideas will just be that: good ideas. Imagine
looking back when you’re 80 years old and feeling like you just dabbled
with 20 different great ideas but never really made the impact you desired.
It doesn’t have to be that way.
Russell’s expertise is massive, and he uses all of it in this book to expose
the “new” way to drive the right people to your product, service, idea,
company, mastermind, or book. He’s giving you secrets that no one has


revealed in this way before, and he does it in a simplistic manner that makes
his lessons easy to absorb and understand.

He reveals exactly how to drive traffic to your business, product, or
website.
This is one of those books that, if consumed and applied properly, could
be a game changer for your life.

By the time you’re done reading this book, you will understand so much
more clearly why certain online companies are thriving and why others are
struggling.
You will understand why the business you started in the past didn’t get
the results you had hoped for.

You might also realize the reason why you’re already doing so well and
learn how you can do even better.
The world has changed. And for those who don’t know how to pivot, a
life of struggle may lie ahead. Or—less dramatic but equally sad—yours
could be a life, a purpose, unrealized. A life in which you don’t tap into
your next level and you never reach your full potential.

In this powerful book, Russell Brunson opens his heart and shares the
tactics and strategies necessary to make sure you reach your full potential.
Hold on tight and discover what it’s like to profit, make an impact, and
create a company with momentum that thrives in today’s world.

### PREFACE

###### YOU BRING THE FIRE...

###### I’LL GIVE YOU THE FRAMEWORK

On September 23, 2014, Todd Dickerson, Dylan Jones, and I launched a
new software company that we naively believed would change the world.
The goal was to create a product that would free all entrepreneurs and give
them the ability to get their message out to the market, faster and easier than
ever before, so they could change the lives of the customers they were
called to serve. The company we launched was called ClickFunnels.
A few short months after we launched ClickFunnels, I released a book
that I had been working on for almost a decade. I was a first-time author,
and because my book was about sales funnels (something that was
_extremely_ exciting to me, but pretty boring to most others), I was nervous
about how people would respond to it. That book was called _DotCom
Secrets_ , and little did I know that book would become _the_ playbook for how
to build sales funnels online and was the key to the initial growth of our
company. When people understood _how_ they could use funnels to grow
their companies... well, they started using funnels to grow their
companies.

```
A few of the core concepts that I first revealed in DotCom Secrets were:
```
```
The secret of the value ladder, and how you can use it to provide
more value to your customers and make more money from every
customer in the process.
How to attract your dream customers that you want to work with
and repel the types of customers you don’t want to work with so you
only spend time serving the people that you enjoy being around.
```

```
The exact funnels and sales scripts you can use to convert website
and funnel visitors into customers and move them through your value
ladder so you can serve them at your highest level.
And a whole bunch more...
```
As Garrett J. White told me after reading the book and applying it to his
company: “I already had the fire, but you gave me the framework I needed
to grow.” Over the next two years, that book became the underground
playbook used by over 100,000 marketers to build their sales funnels
online.

```
Figure 0.1: DotCom Secrets helps marketers to build their sales funnels online. (If you don’t
have the DotCom Secrets book yet, go to DotComSecrets.com to get a free copy.)
```
But as ClickFunnels grew, I started to see a big division between those
who were making money with their funnels and those who made funnels
but weren’t making any money. People had mastered funnel structure and
framework because of _DotCom Secrets_ (and they could quickly build those
funnels inside of ClickFunnels), but some people weren’t making any
money because they lacked the basic understanding of how to convert their
funnel’s visitors into customers. They didn’t understand the fundamentals of


persuasion, storytelling, building a tribe, becoming a leader, and
communicating with the people who entered into their funnels.

And so I began my second book with the goal of helping readers to learn
and master the persuasion secrets that are necessary to convert people at
each stage of their funnels. While _DotCom Secrets_ was the “science” of
funnel building, _Expert Secrets_ became the “art” behind successful funnels,
helping people to move through your funnels and become your dream
customers.

```
Figure 0.2: Expert Secrets helps marketers master the art of converting leads into dream
customers. (If you don’t have the Expert Secrets book yet, go to ExpertSecrets.com to get a free
copy.)
```
That brings us to this book, the third and final volume in the trilogy,
_Traffic Secrets_. Traffic is the fuel for every successful business. It is the
people who are coming into your funnels. The more people you can get in
front of, the bigger impact you and your company can have, which, in turn,
usually creates more money for your company.
As we watched members of ClickFunnels growing their companies with
funnels using the structure from _DotCom Secrets_ and the persuasion skills
they learned from _Expert Secrets_ , many people were still struggling because
they didn’t know how to get consistent traffic or people into their funnels.


On the flip side, those who were getting traffic from Facebook or Google
were nervous that if either of their sources dried up, they could lose their
company overnight.

_Traffic Secrets_ approaches traffic from a completely different direction
than anyone has discussed before: less from the tactical, fly-by-night
operations and more from the strategic, long-term model that will ensure a
consistent flow of people into your funnels. The strategies inside of this
book are evergreen and will never change as long as there are humans on
this planet to sell to.

```
Figure 0.3: Traffic Secrets helps marketers learn the strategies to drive consistent traffic to
their funnels.
```
Each book in the Secrets trilogy was written as a stand-alone playbook,
but mastering the skills from all three books is essential for the long-term
growth of your company. Because of that, each book refers to and ties in
important concepts from the others.
If you are interested in the most up-to-date information, I invite you to go
to MarketingSecrets.com to listen in on my podcast, _Marketing Secrets_. It’s
published twice a week and covers everything we’re learning and
discovering in real time. I share new secrets every week for free that build
on the evergreen topics and frameworks that you’re mastering in these
books.


I hope that you can use this trilogy of books to change the lives of the
customers you have been called to serve. Everything written in these three
books is evergreen and focuses on concepts that have worked yesterday, are
working today, and will continue to work tomorrow and forever.


### INTRODUCTION

###### THERE’S A STORM COMING...

April 27, 2018, was a day that my kids and I had looked forward to for a
long time. It was the opening night of the movie _Avengers: Infinity War_.^2
I’ve been a superhero fan ever since the first _Iron Man_ movie came out, but
not long enough to know the entire history from the original comic books,
so everything that was happening in the movie was a huge surprise to me.
This was the 19th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and all of the
prior movies had culminated into this epic standoff between Thanos and the
Avengers.

In the movie, you see Thanos as the ultimate bad guy, but he actually
thinks he is doing good. He’s concerned that the universe is overpopulated,
and he believes it’s his mission to save it. His goal is to gather all the
infinity stones, put them into his gauntlet (like a big glove), and, when he
snaps his fingers, restore balance to the universe by killing half its
population.
The movie ended (spoiler alert) with a huge cliffhanger after Thanos
collected all the infinity stones and snapped his fingers. In an instant, half
the people in the universe disappeared. The next day after watching the
movie, I was talking to my friend and fellow online marketer Peng Joon
about the movie and he said something that sparked an idea. That idea later
became an event and has since resulted in me writing this book.

Talking about the founder of Facebook, Peng Joon said, “Do you ever
feel that Mark Zuckerberg is like Thanos, and his whole goal is to wipe out
half the entrepreneurs who are advertising on Facebook? He could literally
snap his fingers and half the online entrepreneurs would lose their
businesses overnight.”


That statement quickly got my mind racing back to 2003, the year I
bought my very first Google ad. I had just purchased a book from Chris
Carpenter: _Google Cash_. It showed how easy it was to set up Google ads
and drive them to any website you wanted! It was simple arbitrage. I would
spend $0.25 to get someone to click on my ad, they would go to my
website, and I would (hopefully) make $2–3 dollars in sales for each click I
received.

At first, it seemed too good to be true, but I decided to set up my first ad
in Google selling a DVD on how to make potato guns. When someone
would search for “potato guns” or “spud guns” in Google, my ad would
show up. If they clicked on my ad (charging me $0.25), they would end up
on my website HowToMakeAPotatoGun.com. A percentage of the people
who landed on that page would buy the DVD, and I became an instant
“DotCom thousandaire.” (I wasn’t quite a millionaire yet, but if everything
kept working the way it was those early days, I would have been in just a
few short months!)
But then it happened...
People called it the “Google slap,” but for me it looked like it was the
end to my online career. My costs went from $0.25 a click to $3 per click or
more! Instantly, half the online entrepreneurs who were buying ads on
Google (including myself) lost their businesses overnight.
Most of the people I knew at that time who were making a killing on
Google never recovered from that first Google slap. Most of us were
confused about why Google would charge 10 times the prices of our ads
overnight. Soon, though, after the dust settled, it started to make sense.

Google only wanted the big brands: the companies who would spend a
million dollars a month in ads, not the small guys like me who were just
spending a few thousand dollars a month. The small entrepreneurs like
myself only made up a tiny percentage of their overall revenue, and we
were likely the ones who caused 90 percent or more of their headaches.
They didn’t care about us; they only cared about the really big advertisers.
And what started as the best way for the little guys to have success quickly
disappeared when Larry Page and Sergey Brin (the founders of Google)
decided to give us small entrepreneurs the slap.


In _DotCom Secrets_ , I share that the way I saved myself (and my tiny little
company) from this Google slap was by learning how to use funnels. I
changed my little potato gun website into a funnel where I could make more
money from each visitor who clicked on my ads. Google’s costs didn’t go
down, so I found a way to pay for those costs. I would spend the $3 per
click that Google wanted to charge me, and then I would make $5–$6 from
everyone who came into my funnel. That strategy is outside of the context
of this book, but I write about it extensively in both _DotCom Secrets_ and
_Expert Secrets_.

After that initial Google slap, the entrepreneurs who survived started
looking for other ways to save their companies. Some turned to email
marketing and others turned to paid ads on other blogs and websites, but the
majority of marketers started getting the bulk of their traffic from Google’s
free search platform.
We all started to learn how to play that game. We’d get ranked really high
for the core keywords that we used to pay Google for, and traffic started
coming back to our funnels for free! Again, this seemed like it was too good
to be true, but for years this was the secret!

Then one day, just like before, Google decided it was time to change
things up once again. The next few years were known for dozens of new
Google slaps that affected people who were ranking high in the free search
results.
Each morning we would wake up, hoping and praying that we were still
ranking for the keywords we had worked so hard to earn, but we were at
Google’s mercy. Our future was outside of our own control. Each slap
would take out another huge percentage of entrepreneurs. Soon, they started
giving each of these slaps cute little names like “Panda,” “Penguin,” and
“Hummingbird,” but each new slap meant another group of entrepreneurs
had to wake up to a reality where their companies had dried up overnight.
They had lost all their traffic, and because traffic equaled customers, they
had no business.

The decade from the early 2000s to 2010 was a constant fight for most
entrepreneurs to stay alive. Then, in 2007, the dawn of a new era of online
advertising started when Mark Zuckerberg introduced his new Facebook
Ads platform. Just as Google did when they first opened up their platform,


Facebook made it easy and affordable for entrepreneurs to buy ads. The
costs were low, and arbitrage was simple. Facebook’s goal was adoption: to
get as many people as possible (and as fast as possible) to use their ads
service. And that’s exactly what happened.

For people like me, it was like the good ol’ days of Google where I could
spend $0.25 in ads and make $2–$3 back for each click! Many of the
entrepreneurs whom I now coach started their companies around this time
and have leveraged Facebook to grow their companies quickly.
But for the marketers who have been around long enough to remember
the earlier blood baths that Google and other platforms had put us through,
the patterns of Facebook have almost identically matched what Google did
when it started.

**Step #1) The Adoption:** Make the barrier of entry easy to get everyone in
and using the platform.

**Step #2) The Price Hike:** Slowly raise the prices to squeeze out the
margins, killing off any entrepreneurs who don’t understand how to use
funnels.

**Step #3) The Slap:** Kill off the 50 percent of advertisers who cause 90
percent of their headaches. (If you spend less than $1 million per month on
ads, you’re considered a small advertiser. You only make up a tiny
percentage of their revenue, yet you’re 100 times harder to support than a
big brand who cares less about ROI and more about just seeing their brand
everywhere.)

That day after the movie, Peng Joon and I joked that instead of a Google
slap, we were going to see a Zuckerberg/Thanos (we’ve now nicknamed
him “Zanos”) _snap_ , where 50 percent of all entrepreneur businesses would
disappear overnight.

If you rely 100 percent on Facebook for your traffic, then this is your
warning that a storm is coming. You should implement everything you read
in this book so you can protect your company and thrive during that storm.
On the other hand, if the Zanos snap has already happened and you woke up


one morning to a dead (or quickly dying) business, then this book is your
answer on how to save your company and get it to thrive again.

Over the past decade and a half that I’ve been playing this game, I’ve
survived (and even thrived) during dozens of Google slaps, the “death” of
email marketing, algorithm changes, the rise and fall of tons of social
networks, and the fragmentation of online media. The question begs to be
asked: Why did we survive when so many other companies have failed?

###### TWO REASONS WE SURVIVED WHEN OTHERS FAILED

```
We understand how to use funnels. With funnels, we can make 5–10
times as much money for each visitor who clicks on our ads, so we
survive and thrive when costs go up.
We have mastered the strategy (not just the tactics) behind getting
traffic, and these strategies work on all advertising platforms in the
past, present, and future. If you master these strategies, then no slap or
snap can affect the lifeblood of your company.
```
There will be another storm soon, just like there was with Google. It’s
happened time and time again, and we know that the greatest predictor of
the future is the past. This storm is headed our way, and thousands of
entrepreneurs are unaware.
I feel like I have a moral responsibility to the 100,000-plus members of
our ClickFunnels community and to the 1,000,000-plus entrepreneurs who
follow me, and to anyone else who will listen to prepare them for this
storm. Those who master these strategies will absorb the traffic, customers,
and sales of those who were not prepared. Master these principles and you
and your company will thrive.

###### AN EVERGREEN BOOK ABOUT THE FASTEST CHANGING

###### TOPIC OF ALL TIME?

My biggest fear when I decided to take on writing this book was figuring
out how to create a book about traffic that was evergreen. After all, how do


you teach concepts that will last forever on a topic that changes almost
daily? Every book that I’ve read about traffic in the past 10 years has
focused on trendy tactics, which usually became irrelevant within months of
being published. Oftentimes they became obsolete before they even got to
print.

The tactics behind how to get someone to click on an ad and come to
your website literally change daily. In fact, I know people whose full-time
jobs are solely dedicated to keeping up to speed with the changes that
Facebook makes to its algorithm and Ads Manager. If I try to give you the
latest tactic or hack that works today, by the time you read this paragraph, it
will likely be _wildly_ out of date.
How many of us would have known five or six years ago that Instagram
would be the powerhouse it is today? Who could have foreseen that
Messenger bots would turn into a really cool thing, then be almost dead in
the water for a few months because of Facebook legal troubles, and shortly
thereafter come back to life? What social platforms and technologies are
still waiting to be discovered that we haven’t even yet conceived?

I then started to think about the wake of dead businesses I had seen in the
past 15 years. So many entrepreneurs found temporary success because they
figured out one way to get traffic or they mastered one tactic (e.g., Google
ads or SEO), but then in one quick slap, they lost everything.
I started thinking about why I’d been able not to just survive during each
of the slaps, but actually thrive. The more I thought about why we’ve done
so well, despite the constant changes, the more I realized that I didn’t learn
traffic the way most other entrepreneurs learned traffic.

Normally, most people learn how to get traffic in the following manner.
A new website will become popular and quickly grow a big user base where
entrepreneurs will see an opportunity where they can buy or earn traffic on
this new platform—for example, Twitter or Facebook. A group of early
adopters start using it, and they figure out the tricks to leverage the platform
to get traffic. For the next few months or years, they use these concepts to
mine out tons of traffic at very low costs.
Eventually, more people find out about it and start using these channels.
With more demand for this new traffic, the supply goes down, and the
platforms start charging more money for each click. An entrepreneur may


see the opportunity that this new tactic has created and try to capitalize on it
by teaching others how to do it. After learning how to exploit this new
traffic, tens of thousands of new people start using the platform. Demand
goes up, supply goes down, and prices quickly increase.

Others see the success of this new course teaching this new tactic, and
they want in. A few dozen copycat courses come out, and now there’s a
small army of people selling courses on how to leverage this new type of
traffic. Demand goes up, supply goes down, and prices keep going up.
Somewhere in this process, you (or the marketing person on your team)
see the ad for the course, so you buy it, study it, and start leveraging this
new loophole. How much you are paying for these ads will depend on how
early you got in, which also determines how much success you’ll have
using this tactic. Eventually, the costs will get high enough that most
businesses will no longer be able to profitably use these tactics. Those who
understand funnels will last much longer because they will make more
money from each visitor who clicks on their ads, but this tactic will soon
become obsolete.

This process is how most people learn to get traffic to their websites and
into their funnels, and that’s where the problem comes from. How are you
supposed to build your foundation for your company on a slippery slope
like that?
The reason I am still here today is because when I started playing this
game 15 years ago, there weren’t any traffic courses teaching the latest
tactics. The people I studied with didn’t have the internet when they were
growing their companies. The people I learned from were some of the old-
school, direct response marketing greats like Dan Kennedy, Bill Glazer,
Gary Halbert, Jay Abraham, Joe Sugarman, Chet Holmes, Fred Catona,
Don Lapre, Eugene Schwartz, David Ogilvy, and Robert Collier. These
guys didn’t have the luxury of Facebook or Google; they learned the
strategies of driving traffic before there even was an internet! Instead, they
drove traffic with direct mail, radio ads, TV, and newspapers.

These direct response marketers forced me to look at marketing and sales
in a completely different way than people do today. They trained me on the
core strategies of what makes a direct mail campaign work: how to get
radio, magazines, or classified ads to profitably drive customers to you. The


strategies I mastered during a decade of studying direct response marketing
gave me a very different lens which has given my companies the ability to
be at the front of the new trends, master the emerging tactics before most
people even know they exist, see opportunities that are invisible to most
everyone else, and laugh every time there is a Google slap or Zanos snap.

Moving forward, you have to understand that traffic is people, and people
are extremely predictable. The core strategies that I’m going to teach you
will outlast and supersede any particular platform, so you can apply them
anywhere.

###### THE BIG CHALLENGE

Some of you may be shocked or offended that nowhere in this book—a
book entirely about traffic—will you see a single image of the Facebook
Ads editor or a detailed explanation showing you how to set up your
Google Ads campaign. I didn’t put any platform-specific screenshots inside
of this book because I wanted this work to remain evergreen for you. The
backends of each system are constantly changing, and any snapshot I take
today would be out of date before you even started reading.
Instead, we will be focusing on strategies that don’t change, including:

```
Identifying your dream customers
Finding out where they are already congregating online
Learning how to “work” your way in
Understanding how to “buy” your way in
Creating your own publishing platform
Building your own distribution lists
```
All these strategies have one big thing in common: when the storms
come, the user interface changes, or the traffic moves, they will still work!
They leverage the big media properties (such as Google, YouTube,
Facebook, and Instagram) when they are hot, but also when these platforms
change, you can easily move to where the eyeballs go. It worked for me
when I was forced to move from Friendster (most of you don’t even


remember Friendster, do you?) to Myspace to Facebook... and it will work
when we have to move from Facebook and Google to the next big networks
too!

This book will give you the safety and security you need to know that
your business, traffic, and leads are all on stable ground. In Section One,
you will learn how to identify exactly who your dream customers are,
where you can find them, and how to get access to them. In Section Two, I
will show you the simple pattern that you can use to drive traffic into your
funnels from any advertising network, including Facebook, Instagram,
Google, and YouTube. I’ll also demonstrate how mastering this simple
pattern will unlock the doors to a consistent stream of traffic on any of these
networks. Finally, Section Three will reveal powerful growth hacking
techniques that will help you to increase your traffic even if you don’t have
access to Facebook or Google or any other advertising networks.
Mastering these growth hacks will give you the ability to build your
traffic foundation on solid ground. I’ve spent over 15 years learning and
mastering these concepts and strategies, and I’m so excited to be able to
give them to you right now!


# SECTION ONE

## YOUR DREAM CUSTOMER

The phone rang. It was Chad. Well, he was Chad to me, but to his patients,
his name was Dr. Woolner.

“Hello?” I answered.

“Hey, man. I know it’s late, but do you have some time to talk? I’m in a
really bad place right now.”

“Sure,” I quickly responded. “I’ll be right over.”

Just five years earlier, Dr. Woolner had graduated with his Doctorate of
Chiropractic (DC) degree. Shortly thereafter, he moved his family to Boise,
Idaho, to work as an associate chiropractor for a new clinic in town. His
goal wasn’t to work for someone else, though. While Chad is an amazing
chiropractor, he’s an even better entrepreneur, and he wanted to start his
own practice. He went through the process of writing a business plan,
getting a small business loan, remodeling a new office, getting logos
designed, and everything else that goes into starting your own business.

I knew that business had been slow ever since he had opened his doors, but
I didn’t know how slow until I got to his office that night.

“I’m not gonna make it,” he said. “We’re out of money and we have no
way to get more patients in the door.”

I spent some time talking to him about the situation and gave him some
possible ideas to get more business. Then he said something that hit me like
a ton of bricks.

“I went to college for four years to get my degree, then I spent an additional
four years at chiropractic college to become a chiropractor. In all that time,


_not once did they ever talk about how to actually get patients to come to my
clinic_ .”

Isn’t that unbelievable? They could lock up an entrepreneur for eight years
to teach them a skill, but not even spend 10 minutes showing them how to
market that skill. To me, it’s the biggest problem with our education
system, and it’s one of the biggest issues that plague new entrepreneurs in
any market. They believe that if they build a great product, or create an
amazing company, the customers will automatically follow.

I see entrepreneurs who will invest every last penny they have to create the
products and services they think will change the world without ever
considering who their dream customers are or how they’re going to reach
them.

They’ll happily invest in coaching, product creation, design, education—
almost everything—but when you then tell them to buy ads on Facebook or
Google, they freeze. Or when you tell them that they’re going to have to
put in their own time and sweat equity to get visitors organically, they often
think they’re above it.

Some think, _My product is so good, I don’t need to pay for traffic_.

Still others believe they’re entitled to customers because they feel they built
a better product than their competitors. So they wait, all the while thinking,
_I built it. Why aren’t they coming?_

Yet after coaching hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs, I can tell you
that the people who put all their focus on creating something amazing
(instead of also focusing on getting people to actually see what they
created) are the people that fail. The biggest problem they have is getting
their future customers to discover that they even exist. Every year, tens of
thousands of businesses start and fail because the entrepreneurs don’t
understand this one essential skill: **the art and science of getting traffic
(or people) to find you.**

And that is a tragedy.


I feel like I have been called and placed on this earth with a mission to help
entrepreneurs get their messages out to the world about their products and
services. I strongly believe that entrepreneurs are the only people on earth
who can actually change the world. It won’t happen in government, and I
don’t think it will happen in schools.

It’ll happen because of entrepreneurs like you who are willing to risk
everything to try and make that dream become a reality.

For all the entrepreneurs who fail in their first year of business, it is a
tragedy when the one thing they risked everything for never gets to see the
light of day.

Waiting for people to come to you is not a strategy.

But understanding exactly _who_ your dream customer is, discovering where
they’re congregating, and throwing out hooks that will grab their attention
to pull them into your funnels (where you can tell them a story and make
them an offer) _is_ the strategy. That’s the big secret.

The good news for Dr. Wooler is that after that night, he started geeking out
on funnels. He built a client acquisition funnel and learned how to buy ads
on Facebook and Google. His funnel now generates new patients for him
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and to this day he has a thriving practice.

I’m assuming that if you’re reading this book now, you have a product,
service, or a skill that you’ve focused countless hours mastering. This book
will become your education on getting people to actually see your art.

This section of the book will be focusing on answering two very important
questions:

```
Question #1: Who is your dream customer?
Question #2: Where are they congregating?
```
When you have a _perfect_ vision of who your dream customer is, it becomes
easy to find where they are congregating. On the contrary, if you don’t have
perfect clarity on _who_ that person is, it’s really hard to find them. When you


have completed this section, you’ll know exactly who your dream customer
is and where they are hiding so you can get their attention long enough to
tell them your story.


# SECRET #1

## WHO IS YOUR DREAM CUSTOMER?

```
image
```
**Figure 1.1: Each business needs to understand their dream customer
avatars better than the customers know themselves.**

“I don’t know if Alexis will like this,” said an executive at Sally Beauty
Supply.

Confused, my friend Perry Belcher asked, “What?” He set down his new
scented hand sanitizer that he had brought in to pitch at the meeting.

He picked up his new UV nail polish and handed it to the group. “Okay,
well, how about this product?” he asked.

They looked at it, opened it up, and smelled it. “Yeah, I’m pretty sure that
Alexis won’t like this either,” they replied.

More confused than ever, and now a little frustrated, Perry brought out his
third and final product to pitch to them.

In a similar fashion, they looked at the product, gave it a quick once-over,
and then said, “Sorry, Alexis _definitely_ wouldn’t be interested in this one
either.”

More frustrated, Perry looked at the two execs he was talking to and finally
blurted, “ _Who is Alexis?!_ Is she the decision maker? Why isn’t she in this
meeting instead of you two? Is she here? Can I just talk directly to her? I
know that I can convince her that your company needs to sell these
products!”

There was a moment of silence, and then both of the execs burst out in
laughter.


“Alexis isn’t a person. She’s our customer avatar!” one replied.

“What?” Perry asked. He had never heard of a customer avatar before. “I’m
sorry, I don’t understand. Alexis isn’t a real person?”

The execs just smiled at each other and asked Perry to follow them into
another room.

When they entered the new room, he saw a wall full of pictures of
“Alexis,” a fictitious character who represented Sally Beauty Supply’s
dream customer. The wall also featured a full bio about who she was, how
many kids she had, where she lived, how much money she made, and the
type of home she lived in.

The execs then went on to explain that everyone in the company was
trained that when they make _any_ decision about what products to purchase,
what colors to use in the stores or their branding, what ads to run, what
promotions to create, what their websites looked like, and what music to
play in their locations, _everything_ was run through the lens of Alexis’s eyes.

If it was something that Alexis would love, then the answer was yes. If it
wasn’t something she would love, then the answer was always no.

They didn’t run a product-centric company; they ran a _customer-centric_
company.

Their customer avatar is what drove everything from the products they
created to the ads that they ran.

When Perry first told me this story, I had my big “aha”!

Most entrepreneurs mistakenly think that their business is about them, but
it’s not. On the contrary, your business is about your customer.

If you want customers (traffic) to come into your funnels, then you have to
be able to find them online. And if you want to find them online, then you
have to start to understand them at a much deeper level.


#### BECOMING OBSESSED WITH YOUR DREAM

#### CUSTOMERS

The first step in this process is to become obsessed with your dream
customer. Companies that become obsessed with their products will
eventually fail.

As we’ve grown ClickFunnels, I’ve seen this happen time and time again.
Every company we competed against—even though some of them had
hundreds of millions of dollars in funding behind them—eventually lost to
us because they were busy focusing on their product while we became
obsessed with our customers.

What do I mean when I say obsessed? Being obsessed with your customer
means understanding them just as well, if not better, than they understand
themselves.

For many, this is the most difficult part of the process, even though you
may have actually been your “dream customer” not too long ago. Often,
just remembering how you felt when you were trying to solve the very
problem you’re now solving for people is usually hard.

I was recently talking to my friend Nicholas Bayerle about the fact that
most businesses are created from a problem that an entrepreneur had, and
their product or service was the result of them figuring out the solution to
that problem. “Our mess becomes our message,” Nicholas said.

When you’re frustrated about a problem you’re having, you look for a
solution. If you’re not able to find a solution that gives you the result you
want, then you’ll likely go on a journey to find or create your own solution.
In that way, your problem becomes your business; in other words, your
mess becomes your message.

If that’s true, then you need to look back in time to find the point where you
were struggling with the same problem your dream customer has now.
Then you need to remember what you were feeling when you were in that
pain.


In our community, we have so many amazing examples of leaders who
have made their mess their message, and one of my favorite power couples
is Stacey and Paul Martino. Years ago, they found themselves at a
crossroads. Their relationship was broken. Paul had tried for months to
stay, but eventually, he felt so much pain that he decided to leave. As he
broke the news to Stacey late one night, she broke down and cried. Her
relationship was over, and the pain she felt was too much to bear.

I won’t tell their full story here, but the short version is that because of this
experience, Stacey knew that to save her relationship, she needed to change
first. She put in the work to transform herself, and in the process of her
changing, Paul changed as well. After saving their own marriage, they
developed a unique process to heal marriages that doesn’t require “couples
work.” Instead, they believe that it takes just one person in a relationship to
change it for the good.

Their mess became their message and now they have dedicated their lives
to helping others find relief from the same pain that they felt years earlier.
With their unique system and tools, they’ve helped to save thousands of
marriages. In a society where more than 50 percent of all marriages end in
divorce, the students who go through their program only have a 1 percent
divorce rate.

Stacey and Paul are successful at finding and helping their dream
customers because just a few years ago, they were their dream customers.
Because they really, deeply understood the pain, they could identify their
dream customers’ goals and aspirations and could identify where they were
congregating to help move them toward those goals. They are a product of
their product.

In the early 20th century, Robert Collier published one of the great books
on copywriting, _The Robert Collier Letter Book_. In this book, he shares
how to really understand your customers. If you’re going to find them,
persuade them to follow you, and hopefully change their lives with the
products and services you sell, you need to know and understand them
better than they understand themselves.


Collier believed that we as marketers should not be trying to figure out how
to create the next amazing ad campaign, but instead we need to learn how

to _“enter the conversation already taking place in the customer’s mind.”_^3

If you want to really understand who your dream customers are and where
they are congregating online, you need to be able to enter the conversation
that is already taking place inside of their mind and see the world the way
that they see it.

When you truly understand the core pains they are trying to move away
from and the core desires and passions they are trying to move toward, it
becomes very easy to identify exactly where they exist online. As soon as
you know where they are online, then you can hook them and bring them
into your funnels where you can serve them. We will go into greater detail
on how to do that throughout the rest of the book.

Now that we have the foundation covered, let’s dive into identifying your
dream customer with the 3 Core Markets, sometimes known as the 3 Core
Desires.

#### THE 3 CORE MARKETS/DESIRES

```
image
```
**Figure 1.2: People purchase products hoping to get a certain result
from one of these 3 core desires/markets.**

In _Expert Secrets_ , I introduced the concept of the 3 Core Markets, or the 3
Core Desires. The three desires (in no particular order) are health, wealth,
and relationships. When people purchase any product from anyone, they’re
hoping to get a certain result in one of these three areas of their lives. So
the first question you need to answer is this:

Which of these three desires is my future dream customer trying to receive
when they buy my product or service?

This is the first layer to getting inside the mind of your dream customer,
and for most people the answer is pretty simple. However, sometimes


people get stuck on this question for one of two reasons.

**Reason #1 — My product fits into** **_more_** **than one of these desires:** Many
products can be marketed toward getting a result in more than one of these
desires, but your marketing message can only focus on _one_ of them.
Anytime you try to get your potential customer to believe in two things,
your conversions will usually cut in half (most times by 90 percent or
more). To target two different desires, you need two different ads leading to
two different funnels. Only focus on one desire with each message you put
into the market.

**Reason #2 — My product doesn’t fit into any of these desires:** This false
belief was best resolved at one of our recent events where someone told
one of my head coaches, Steve J Larsen, this exact same thing. Steve
responded by telling the story of Gillette razors and asking which desire a
razor fulfilled.

At first everyone was quiet, and then a few people started guessing.
“Health?” Another mumbled, “Or maybe... hmmm.. .”

Steve then played one of Gillette’s ads. In it, you see how a story develops.
First, a man is shown shaving. After the shave, a beautiful woman gets
closer to him. Then the two go out for a night on the town. Finally, the ad
shows the two together back home in their room.

After showing the ad, Steve asked the question again a little differently,
“What desire was this marketing message created for?”

Instantly everyone responded, “Relationships!”

Most products can fit into multiple categories, even if they may look as if
they don’t fit into any category at all, but no matter what, the key is that
your marketing message can and must be focused on only one of the 3 Core
Desires. I want you to take a few minutes and decide which of the 3 Core
Markets or Desires your product or service currently fits into.

#### AWAY FROM PAIN/TOWARD PLEASURE


```
image
```
**Figure 1.3: All humans either move away from pain or toward
pleasure.**

Now that you’ve identified which core desire your product or service is
focused on, the next step to entering the conversation inside your
customer’s mind is to understand which direction they are moving. Every
human being on this planet is always moving in one of two directions when
they make a decision: away from pain or toward pleasure.

**Moving Away from Pain:** The first direction that people can be moving in
is away from pain. Let me show you a few examples of moving away from
pain for each desire.

**Health (moving away from pain)**

```
I’m overweight and don’t feel comfortable in my clothes.
I don’t have energy and feel tired all of the time.
I hate what I see when I look into the mirror.
```
**Wealth (moving away from pain)**

```
I hate my job and want to fire my boss.
I have no money saved, and I’m scared I could lose my job.
Everyone around me makes more money than I do.
```
**Relationships (moving away from pain)**

```
I’m in a bad relationship and don’t know how to get out.
I feel alone and want to feel what love feels like.
I feel awkward when I’m around people I don’t know.
```
Each of those statements above are conversations that people are having
inside of their own minds. While these are broad examples, when I actually
wrote down the thoughts that my particular dream customer was having, I


did three things to try to understand the conversation that they were having
with themselves each day.

```
1. I wrote out hundreds of phrases that I used to say to myself when I
was trying to solve the problem for myself initially.
2. I looked online in forums, message boards, and groups to see what
others are saying when they are trying to get out of pain.
3. I really tried to put myself in their shoes and wrote out what I believed
people were thinking.
```
#### EXERCISE

For this exercise, I want you to write down at least a dozen things that your
potential future customers are saying or thinking as they’re trying to move
away from pain. This exercise is something you should be continually
doing every day. I’m always looking for the questions and statements that
people in my market are saying as they try to move out of their pain.

```
image
```
**Figure 1.4: Exercise: Write down all the things your dream customers
are saying or thinking as they move away from pain.**

**Moving Toward Pleasure:** The second direction that people can be
moving in is toward pleasure. They don’t have a desire for health, wealth,
or relationships because they are unhappy; they have a desire because they
are happy and looking for more. Let me show you a few examples of
moving toward pleasure for each desire.

**Health (moving toward pleasure)**

```
I want to get six-pack abs.
I want to be able to run a marathon.
I want to eat healthier so I can get more energy.
```
**Wealth (moving toward pleasure)**


```
I want to buy my dream house or dream car.
I want to grow my company so I can have more impact.
I want to learn leadership so I can grow my team.
```
**Relationships (moving toward pleasure)**

```
I want more passion in my relationships.
I want to spend more time with my spouse and kids.
I want to meet more people through networking.
```
Do you see how different these phrases are even though they are addressing
the same core desire? I wanted to put them together in a chart so you could
see them side by side. It’s powerful to see that while everyone may be
trying to accomplish the same goal, the reasons why they’re doing it are
almost polar opposites.

```
image
```
**Figure 1.5: While two people’s goals might be the same, their reasons
for accomplishing that goal might be completely different.**

#### EXERCISE

Now I want you to spend a few minutes doing this second exercise. Write
down at least a dozen phrases that people in your market who are moving
toward pleasure may have running on a loop in their head.

```
image
```
**Figure 1.6: Exercise: Write down all the things your dream customers
are saying or thinking as they move toward pleasure.**

The more phrases you can find, the more traffic streams you’ll be able to
tap into, so make it a continual process to identify and write down the
conversations happening inside of your customers’ minds. And as you’ll
see in the next secret, understanding the phrases that are going on inside of


your customers’ minds in both directions (moving away from pain or
toward pleasure) will guide you to finding them.

#### THE SEARCHER AND THE SCROLLER

To really understand how to use the conversations that are going on inside
of the minds of your dream customers, we need to go back in time a few
hundred years before the internet, before TV, and before radio to where
traffic began.

Until the early 1800s, people mainly obtained products based on what they
needed. They would be in some type of pain, and they would search for a
solution to solve it. It started with food. Our ancestors had a desire for
health (food), so they would search for food, kill it, and bring it home. In
more modern times, we have stores. When you need food or something else
at your home, you go to the local store, search for what you need, and buy
it.

In 1886, the Yellow Pages directory was created, and it was awesome for
consumers because you could find exactly what you needed, and business
owners had the luxury of people simply showing up, looking for what they
had to sell. It seemed like the perfect solution, except for one thing: as a
business owner, if you wanted to make more money or grow your company,
you were not in control. You had to wait for people to have a need in order
for them to come and find you.

But then, in 1927, the television was invented, and just 15 short years later,
on July 1, 1942, during a Brooklyn Dodgers–Philadelphia Phillies game at

Ebbets Field, the first-ever TV commercial aired.^4 At the time, there were
over 4,000 televisions in New York, and that day, while families gathered
around to watch the big game on NBC, it was interrupted by the first-ever
TV commercial. That ad, which was just nine seconds long and cost only
$9, featured a map of America with a Bulova watch clockface in the
middle. At the end of the ad, a voice announced, “America runs on Bulova
time.” And with those nine seconds, the shift from search advertising to
interruption advertising had officially begun.


People watching TV that night were not searching for a new watch, but as
they saw the commercial and the picture of the watch, it placed a seed of
desire in their hearts and minds. They didn’t need this watch, but they
wanted it.

This TV commercial gave business owners a window where they could
grab their potential customers’ attention long enough to plant that seed of
desire and show the perceived value of what they were selling. No longer
would people only buy when they needed something; now advertisers had
the ability to create desire and sell people stuff that they wanted.

This interruption advertising started happening in other types of media such
as radio, newspapers, and direct mail. The process was simple: get a
captive audience, entertain or educate them, and then, when you have their
full attention, interrupt them with your message. You can then grab their
attention and create desire for the product or service that you are selling.

Nowadays, this type of interruption advertising happens every day around
you, but I’m guessing you don’t realize how profound of an impact those
advertisements actually make on your buying decisions. To show you how
effective interruption advertising is versus traditional search advertising
behind the scenes, I will share a story from my friend Trevor Chapman.

Trevor used to run a big sales team of people who sold alarm systems door
to door. At the time, if you were to go to Amazon and search for “home
security systems,” you would quickly find hundreds of options, each one
competing on price. If someone had a need for an alarm and went to
Amazon to buy it, usually they would buy the cheapest one that still had the
highest ratings.

Trevor then compared people searching online for home security systems to
what his sales team did every day. He explained, “We would go down the
street and knock on people’s doors and interrupt them from their day.
Minutes earlier, they had no desire for a home security system. Because we
interrupted them, though, we had a small window where we could make a
presentation and show them the perceived value of our home alarm system.
This presentation would create a desire in them to buy the alarms from us.
We would then make them a special offer that they could only get from us,


right there, right then. In less than an hour, we’d walk away with a monthly
monitoring contract that would be worth over $2,999 to us in the next five
years as opposed to the $199 version they would get by buying the alarm
on Amazon.”

It’s interesting to note that when the internet started a few decades ago, it
followed a very similar pattern. It began with searches. People had some
type of need, usually to get out of some type of pain, and they would
immediately go to the search engines looking for a solution to their
problems. Later we were all introduced to social media through platforms
including Myspace, Facebook, and Instagram; and just like the Bulova ad
in 1941, in 2007 Facebook announced the first-ever social interruption
advertising with Facebook Ads. People would be online talking to their
friends, posting pictures, liking images and videos, and then suddenly, your
ad would show up in their Facebook feed. You’d have a small window of
time to grab their attention, create a desire for your product or service, and
make a special offer.

```
image
```
**Figure 1.7: People will either be searching for your product (left), or
you will interrupt them (right) to get their attention with your ads as
they are scrolling.**

**Pros and Cons for Search:** The pro for search-based traffic is that when
they come to you, they’re hot buyers who are ready to buy. This is similar
to people who walk into your store or find you in the Yellow Pages and
give you a call.

The con with search-based traffic is that they’re not just searching; they’re
also comparing options with your competitors. You’ve got to be the price
leader, as well as the quality leader and the niche leader. People who are
searching are also researching all those things, so until you become good at
funnels and offers, you’ll likely be trying to beat your competitors by
lowering your prices. Unfortunately, trying to be the cheapest product is
never a good strategy.


**Pros and Cons for Interruption:** As a marketer, you can target people
who are interested in certain people, ideas, TV shows, or bands, and then
you can interrupt them with your ads. You open a small window of time
where you can grab their attention and show them the perceived value of
what you’re selling. You no longer have to wait around for someone to
come looking for you. Now you can create desire in your dream customers.

The pro for social-based interruption traffic is that you can target warm
traffic based on people’s interests. Therefore, you can sell based on the
perceived value of your product or service.

The con for social-based interruption traffic is that because the customer
isn’t actively looking for you, you have to become good at your “Hook,
Story, Offer,” where you can grab their attention, tell them a story, and then
make them an offer. We will be covering how to do this in more detail in
Secret #3.

Now that you’ve identified who your dream customer avatar is, what their
core desires are, and if they are moving away from pain or toward pleasure,
the next question we want to ask is “Where are they congregating?” As you
will learn in the next chapter, there are congregations where the scrollers
are hanging out, and congregations you can target for the searchers.


##### SECRET #2

### WHERE ARE THEY HIDING? THE DREAM

### 100

One day in college, I knew I was supposed to be doing homework, but my
ADHD mind couldn’t take it anymore. I had to stop writing, even if it was
just for a few minutes. I looked around to make sure no one else was
looking, then I opened a new tab on my browser.
I started typing _[http://www.TheMat.com](http://www.TheMat.com)_ and then, within seconds, I was taken
to a new universe: a universe occupied by hundreds of thousands of
wrestlers just like me, all around the world. This was our playground where
we could talk about wrestling, post pictures and videos, and debate about
who was going to win every match happening at the next big tournament.

I read a few articles and watched a video showing a new way to finish a
single-leg takedown. Afterward, I went to the forums. Oh, how I loved the
forums! _Who is better? Dan Gable in his prime or Cael Sanderson now?_
someone had just posted. Of course, I had an opinion, and it took
everything I had not to spend the next 90 minutes writing my thoughtful
response about how if we shrunk Cael down to Dan’s size and took him in a
time machine back to the ’70s, Cael would have destroyed Dan head to
head, but I knew I couldn’t. My paper was due the next day, and I was
locked away in study hall until it was done. Angrily, I closed down the tab
and sat back in my chair to stretch before I made the trip back to reality.
As I was leaning back, I started looking at my other wrestler friends who
were locked away in study hall with me because of our bad grades. As I
glanced toward our 133-pounder, I noticed a smile on his face. _What? How
could he be smiling in study hall?_ As I shifted my gaze from his face to his


monitor, I saw it. He was also on TheMat.com, and he was writing his
comments on why he thought Dan would actually beat Cael!

Then, looking at the other wrestlers in the room, I decided I had to know
what they were doing. Faking that I had to go to the bathroom, I stood up
and started to walk past their desks. I looked at our 157-pounder’s screen.
Yup, he was looking at TheMat.com too. The 178-pounder? TheMat.com!
_But what about our heavyweight? He_ has _to be actually doing his
homework, right?_ Nope, he was also on TheMat.com, and as I passed his
computer, I quickly read his forum reply that Bruce Baumgartner (two-time
Olympic heavyweight champ and four-time Olympic medalist) would beat
both Dan and Cael at the same time.
_WHAT!?! Was he crazy? There was no way that Cael would lose to Bruce_

_..._ That’s when it hit me. TheMat.com was our little corner of the internet.
All the wrestlers in study hall were congregated on that website talking
about wrestling, but we weren’t the only ones. Wrestlers in other colleges
across the country, along with high school wrestlers and their parents, were
on the website too. All around the world, hundreds of thousands of people
were all together in this one spot to talk about the topic that we loved most:
wrestling.

Honestly, that is the real power of the internet: it has allowed us to
connect with like-minded people in a way that wasn’t possible before. It’s
allowed each of us, with our unique and sometimes weird hobbies and
interests, to congregate with _our people_ to discuss the things that mean the
most to us.
It wasn’t always like that, though. When I was in high school, we didn’t
have TheMat.com, so the only people we had to talk to about wrestling
were the other few dozen wrestlers in our school. But we weren’t the only
group. High school was full of different groups, like the basketball players,
weightlifters, jocks, band members, and kids who played _Magic: The
Gathering_. Before the internet, groups like this were limited in size to how
many people they could find that had the same interests and were located
geographically near them.

Pre-internet, it was expensive for a marketer to sell products and services
to each of these small groups. After all, how do you target just those people
in every city who were interested in what you have to sell?


If you had a huge mass market product, like shampoo or pain killers, you
could run ads on TV and know that mostly everyone who saw your ads
probably had hair or got headaches sometimes, but it was way too
expensive to run an ad for wrestling shoes or training DVDs and pray that
the dozen wrestlers in each city actually saw the ad.

But the internet changed everything. It took the dozen wrestlers from my
high school, and every other school around the world, and put them
together in one spot. If wrestlers were my dream customers and I had a
product to sell to them, I didn’t have to run huge mass media campaigns.
Instead, I could go directly to TheMat.com, or wherever they were
congregating, and just buy ads there, knowing that 100 percent of the
people who actually saw my ads were people interested in wrestling!
Instead of wasting money showing my ads to millions of people who would
not want or need my product, I could make sure that _only_ my dream
customers would ever see what I’m selling. This targeting has cut ad costs
down to a tiny fraction of what people used to have to spend to get access to
their dream customers. This is what has made it possible for smaller
businesses like ours to compete against, and oftentimes even dominate, the
biggest brands.
This same principle is true no matter _who_ your dream customer is. The
internet has made it so that when you find those existing congregations of
your dream customers, it’s like catching fish in a barrel. You simply have to
find the barrel of fish with your dream customers and throw in your hooks.
If your hook is good, it will pull people from that barrel into your funnels!


```
To catch your dream customers, you simply need to throw out enough hooks in an area where
your dream customers are congregating.
```
With Secret #1, you identified your dream customer, and with Secret #2,
you can locate where they’re hiding or congregating. If I was selling a
product to wrestlers, I shouldn’t be asking, “How do I get traffic to my
funnel?” Instead, I should be asking, “Where are my dream customers (in
this case wrestlers) congregating?”

###### EXERCISE

```
Here are some questions you should be asking yourself at this point:
```
```
What are the top websites that my dream customers already go to?
What forums or message boards do they participate in?
What are the Facebook groups they engage in?
Who are the influencers they follow on Facebook and Instagram?
What podcasts do they listen to?
What are the email newsletters they are subscribed to?
What blogs do they read?
What channels are they following on YouTube?
```

```
What keywords are they searching for in Google to find information?
```
These questions will help you to start identifying _where_ your dream
customers are hiding. The answers to these questions should be simple,
especially if you are your dream customer.

When I launched ClickFunnels, it was easy for me to find startup
entrepreneurs (i.e., my dream clients) because I was a startup entrepreneur!
I started looking at where I was already congregating (which podcasts I was
listening to, which blogs I read, which email lists I was on, etc.), and
instantly I knew exactly where my future dream customers were hiding.
If you don’t truly understand your dream customers (everything we
talked about in Secret #1), then it will be hard to find them. But if you
_really_ understand them, then you should already know where they’re
congregating to get out of pain and where they’re congregating to move
toward pleasure. And when you know where they’re congregating, it’s
pretty easy to put your messages or your hooks in front of them and pull
them into your funnels.

One of the common misunderstandings with traffic is that you have to
“create” traffic, but, as you can now see, that just isn’t true. Traffic (your
dream customer) is already there. Your job is to identify where they are, tap
into those existing streams of traffic, throw out some hooks, and then get a
percentage of your dream customers to start coming to you.

###### THE DREAM 100 (ONE TO ONE)

Now that you understand that traffic already exists and isn’t created, I
wanted to share with you a concept I learned from one of my friends, Chet
Holmes, called the “Dream 100.”^5 He wrote about it in detail in his best-
selling book, _The Ultimate Sales Machine_. The way that Chet teaches and
uses the Dream 100 is a little different than how I use it, but understanding
Chet’s model will open up your ability to get unlimited traffic into your
funnels.

Early in Chet’s career, he worked for Charlie Munger, whom you may
know was Warren Buffett’s business partner in Berkshire Hathaway. Chet
sold advertising for one of the company’s legal magazines. At the time, they


were really struggling; they were last in sales in their market. Chet was
working with a database of over 2,000 advertisers. He made sales calls
every day, but they were still dead last at number 15 out of 15 magazines in
their industry.

Then one day Chet had an idea. He did some research and discovered
that out of those 2,000 advertisers, 167 of them were spending 95 percent of
their advertising budgets with his competitors. So he defined those 167
spending all the money in the industry as his best buyers. Then he stopped
marketing to everybody else and focused his time and efforts on those 167
advertisers. His strategy included sending out direct mail pieces with lumpy
objects in them every two weeks, where he followed up on each package
with a phone call. Twice a month he’d mail a package, and twice a month
he’d call.
Because these were the biggest buyers, they were the hardest people to
reach. After four months of following this strategy, he got zero responses.
(Pretty discouraging, right?) Chet was known for what he called PHD (Pig-
Headed Discipline), though, and he refused to give up.

Then, in his fourth month, something changed. He landed his first big
account: Xerox. It was the biggest advertising buy ever for the company. By
the sixth month, he had landed 28 of the 167 advertisers. And with those 28
advertisers, Chet doubled the sales over the previous year and went from
number 15 in the industry to number 1. He kept doubling sales for the next
three years in a row. By the end of year three, he had successfully brought
in _all_ 167 of his Dream 100 as advertisers in their magazine.
Chet said, “The goal of the Dream 100 is to take your ideal buyers from
‘I’ve never heard of this company’ to ‘What is this company I keep hearing
about?’ to ‘I think I’ve heard of that company’ to ‘Yes, I’ve heard of that
company’ to ‘Yes, I do business with that company.’” Chet grew that
company by using the Dream 100 to create one-to-one sales opportunities.

Chet also used this same strategy to penetrate Hollywood. He had written
a screenplay called _Emily’s Song_ , and he had decided he wanted to try to
sell the screenplay to Hollywood. The only problem was he didn’t know
anyone in the entertainment field. So he bought an issue of _Premiere_
magazine that listed “The 100 Most Powerful People in Hollywood,” which
became his Dream 100 list. He used the same Dream 100 process to contact


these people, and within months, he was able to get LeAnn Rimes to read
the script. Together, they went to Warner Bros., where the screenplay was
purchased!

###### THE DREAM 100 (ONE TO MANY)

Chet Holmes’s Dream 100 for “One to One” selling strategy is powerful
when your business model needs a small number of big customers. But for
most of us, we’re looking for _lots_ of customers, not just 100. When I was
starting out, many of the things I sold weren’t very expensive, so it didn’t
make financial sense to send packages and make phone calls to try to sell a
$20 product. That’s why Chet’s Dream 100 concept didn’t make sense when
I first heard it; I couldn’t see how it applied to my online business. In fact,
initially, I completely dismissed the concept and figured it didn’t apply to
companies like mine.

One day, though, as I was writing _DotCom Secrets_ and thinking about
how I was going to sell the book when I was finished writing it, I identified
_who_ my dream customers were that would want to read my book and _where_
they were congregating. I made a list and wrote out _everywhere_ that I could
think my dream customers might be gathering. On that list I identified:

```
10+ top websites and forums they spent time on
15+ active Facebook groups they participated in
50+ influencers they followed on Facebook and Instagram
30+ podcasts they listened to
40+ email newsletters they subscribed to
20+ blogs that they actively read
20+ YouTube channels they subscribed to
```
After making the list, I added up how many subscribers, readers, and
followers each of those channels had. I was so excited to find out that there
were over 30 _million_ of my dream customers on that little list alone, all
congregated inside of those 185-plus communities!


Next, I tried to figure out how to get my message in front of those 30
million-plus people. I brainstormed ideas, and that’s when the bolt of
lightning hit! _The Dream 100!_

No, I couldn’t do a Dream 100 campaign to all 30 million-plus people
because it would cost too much. After all, I was trying to sell my book for
$7.95, so if I did get a yes from a customer, it was only worth $7.95 to me.
But what if, instead, I did a Dream 100 campaign to the owners of those
185-plus communities asking them to promote my book to their audience?
If I could build a relationship with one of them and get just _one_ yes, that
could turn into hundreds or thousands of new customers!
So that’s exactly what I did! I found the contact information for those 185
people, and I sent them each a copy of my book in the mail with a letter
asking if they’d be interested in helping to promote my book on launch day.
Within a week of sending out the packages, I started to get messages back.
One message was from a podcaster on my Dream 100 list whom I’d been
listening to for years but had never actually met: John Lee Dumas from EO
Fire.com. He told me he loved my book, and he asked me to be on his
podcast to talk about it. I quickly agreed, and, within a few days, I was
being interviewed by John Lee Dumas. He asked about my book, told
people why he loved it, and then he told them to go buy a copy. Within a
week of that episode airing, we had sold over 500 books from that one
interview alone!

I didn’t stop there, though. I kept following up with my Dream 100, and
not only did I get on other blogs and podcasts, but people also promoted me
in their email newsletters and more! I ended up landing over 30 of the 185
people as promotional partners.
The second part of the Dream 100 strategy (covered in more detail in
Secret #4) works even for those who didn’t respond or weren’t willing to
promote my book. Advertising platforms like Facebook allow you to target
your ads to people with certain interests. For example, Tony Robbins was in
my Dream 100, and while he didn’t directly promote my first book, he did
directly promote _Expert Secrets_ after over 10 years of being on my Dream
100 list! However, even though he didn’t directly promote _DotCom Secrets_ ,
I still wanted to market to his (at the time) 3.2 _million_ -person audience, as
they were my dream customers too. On Facebook, I was able to buy ads


that were only shown to his audience, and we were able to sell thousands of
copies of my book to his people!

Our launch campaign for my book may have seemed massive from the
outside as we sold over 100,000 copies in a very short period of time, but in
reality, we just put a concentrated effort to market to the dream customers
of 185 people.
Recently, I was at a mastermind event in Puerto Rico, and I had a chance
to spend time with Rachel Hollis, the author of the #1 _New York Times_ best-
seller _Girl, Wash Your Face_. At the time, she was in the middle of launching
her new book, _Girl, Stop Apologizing_. As I was in the middle of writing this
book, I was curious about how she had sold over a million copies of her
books. I asked her for the secret to selling that many copies, and she told
me:

```
We asked ourselves this question: “What are the tribes that my
women are already in? What network marketing companies are they
in? What Facebook groups... what Instagram channels... what
hashtags are they following?” After we identified these things, we tried
to figure out who are the tribe owners of these women. Who do we
need to become friends with? Anyone who had over 200,000
followers, we would direct message (DM) them, tell them who we
were, and ask them if we could talk. We started messaging everyone.
Our focus was to find the tribes, and then figure out the best ways to
infiltrate them.
```
The Dream 100! She didn’t call it that, but that’s _exactly_ what she had
done to quickly become one of the best-selling authors of all time! Now, I
know what some of you are thinking, _Russell, this may work for you and
Rachel when you’re selling books, but I sell something different, so the
Dream 100 can’t work for me._ It always makes me laugh when people think
these concepts will work for every business except their own, when the
reality is that this concept works for every business. Period. Let me share
some more examples.

Recently, I was listening to the _Foundr_ podcast. They were interviewing
Tom Bilyeu, the founder of Quest Nutrition, who had started his business


with a few friends and quickly grew it into a billion-dollar company. During
that interview, he was asked how he grew Quest Nutrition, and Tom replied:

```
We had a very different approach that got a lot of people excited.
Not just about the product, but they felt good about the way we treated
them. We went old school, researching several hundred health and
fitness influencers, then sending them handwritten letters and free
samples. This was all about showing an understanding of what others
were trying to achieve, and that Quest was interested in helping them
connect with their audience.
When people are building a community, they have a real sense of
service to that community. We would send them free product and just
say, “If you like it, tell people, and if you hate it, tell people that too.”
Not trying to steer people’s comments gave us a pretty great
recommendation. Some didn’t like it and said so, but the vast majority
loved it and were grateful we had showed an understanding of who
they were and what they were trying to do, so they spread the word.^6
```
Tom didn’t realize it, but the Dream 100 struck again! It’s the strategy
that almost all successful companies (oftentimes without realizing it) are
using as the backbone of their traffic strategies. When most people hear the
title of _Traffic Secrets_ , they assume I’m just going to show how to run
Facebook or YouTube ads. While those tools are great, they’re just small
external tactics of a much larger strategy.

The core strategy to understand is that your dream customers have
_already_ been congregated by your Dream 100. If you focus on identifying
them and marketing to them, your dream customers will start flowing into
your funnels faster than by anything else you could do.

###### A DIFFERENT DREAM 100 ON EACH PLATFORM

A few years ago, I decided to rebrand my podcast from the _Marketing in
Your Car_ show to the _Marketing Secrets_ show. When we did this, I set it up
as a new podcast and invited all my old listeners to resubscribe and join me
on the new show. I had a lot of my faithful listeners move over to my new


podcast, and then I brainstormed other ways to grow my show. I first started
by leveraging the traffic that I own. I sent emails to my lists asking them to
subscribe, sent out messages to my Messenger lists, and posted on
Facebook, Instagram, and about everywhere else that I had a voice. This did
get a big influx of listeners as all my true fans came over and plugged in.

I was so excited about the immediate growth that I figured this initial
surge would be all we needed as the catalyst that would grow the show.
Unfortunately, it wasn’t. In fact, the show quickly flatlined, and then it
started to shrink. I was completely freaking out, wondering if I made a
mistake starting a new show.
After I sat in my office with a few of the people on my team
brainstorming for hours about how to get our podcast to grow and what
things I could do to get people to share my message, it hit me, the big
“ _aha_ ”! It was so simple in my head, but as I blurted it to my team, it
sounded stupid.

“People who listen to podcasts... Well, they listen to podcasts!” I said.
“Yeah... um... I’m not sure where you’re going with this, Russell,”
my team responded.

I half laughed. “Think about it. We’re trying to get people who love
Instagram to move to Apple to listen to us. While our best fans did come,
the majority didn’t. Why? Because people who are on Instagram love to
consume content on Instagram. The same is true for our blog: our superfans
will move from Facebook and other places to read our blog, but our best
blog readers are people who read other blogs. People who love to watch
YouTube videos love to watch videos on YouTube, and people who listen to
podcasts listen to podcasts.
“We can spend a ton of time and money convincing people on these other
platforms to move to podcasts, or we can spend that same time and money
focusing on the people who are already listening to podcasts. If they find a
new show they love, they’ll listen every day!”

That was the big “aha” that set into motion our strategy for building a
special Dream 100 list just for our podcast through the other podcasts that
our dream listeners were listening to. It also caused us to build out Dream
100 lists for every platform we’ve talked about already.


You see, prior to this big “aha,” we only had one big collective Dream
100 list with people from all the platforms. We hadn’t respected the fact that
people like to consume media in their own favorite ways, and while it’s
possible to move people from one platform to another, there is much less
resistance when you just migrate people to you who are already on the
platform that they love.

###### WHAT ABOUT “BRICK-AND-MORTAR”-TYPE BUSINESSES?

At this point, some of you may be thinking, _But Russell, I’m not selling a
book or a product online. I’m a local brick-and-mortar business trying to
generate local leads online, so this won’t work for me._ For all my brick-and-
mortar business owners, don’t worry, this strategy still works, even though
you will need to look at it a little differently. When building your Dream
100 list, instead of identifying the national influencers or leaders in your
niche, you need to identify your local influencers.

For example, if I owned a local juice bar, I would ask myself: Who is my
dream customer and where are they already congregating? My dream
customer would be someone who is trying to get healthier. To find these
dream customers, I would create a list of the local gyms, health food stores,
chiropractors, personal trainers, nutritionists, etc., and then start building
my Dream 100 from that list.
We’ll show more examples of how these concepts work for brick-and-
mortar businesses throughout this book, but I wanted to address it quickly
here before some of you thought that this concept wouldn’t work for you.

###### CREATING YOUR DREAM 100 LIST


```

ecrets.com/resources to download your copy.
```
The next step is for you to build out your Dream 100 list. Everything we do
from this point forward from paid ads to free traffic to joint ventures will all
build from this core foundation of the Dream 100. But for some reason,
even though I’ve been talking about this concept for years and it seems easy
enough for people to understand, very few people ever sit down to do the
work and actually build it out.

If you were to hire me today for a $100,000 consulting day, the first thing
I would do with you is spend the first three to four hours building out this
list. That is how important it is, so don’t skip it! Yes, it’s simple, but it’s the
foundation to everything!
In my friend Dana Derricks’s book _The Dream 100_ , I wrote the foreword,
which includes:

```
As the CEO and cofounder of the fastest growing, non-VC-backed
software company in history, hitting nine figures in under three years,
it would seem difficult to narrow down the ONE thing that really
propelled us to where we are more than anything else... But, it’s not.
```

```
It’s the Dream 100. The Dream 100 is the foundation for our entire
company.
At ClickFunnels, we don’t just leverage the Dream 100 approach for
traffic... we use it for EVERYTHING. How do we pick the market
we want to enter? We use the Dream 100 to research different markets
and niches, then we narrow in on the ones that suit us best. How do we
decide on our blue-ocean strategy? We use the Dream 100 to find the
red oceans and carve out our place in the market. How do we create
our offers and figure out what’s going to sell? We use the Dream 100
to model offers that are working in our marketplace, which takes out
the headache and hassle of “blind guessing.”
Everything we’ve done has come off of mastering the Dream 100
and, specifically, knowing how to complement as opposed to compete.
That’s how you build your foundation. From there, you just get traffic
(again, tapping into the Dream 100)... and the rest is history... The
Dream 100 is where ALL traffic leads (whether it’s Facebook Ads,
integration marketing, you name it) to and from. It all circles back to
the Dream 100. If there’s one area to invest as much time and money
into your business as you possibly can, from the beginning, it’s the
Dream 100.^7
```
You see, the Dream 100 is the key foundation for traffic _and_ the key
foundation for your entire business because it helps you to figure out how to
position your offers and tell your stories. I cover this extensively in _DotCom
Secrets_ and _Expert Secrets_ , but I want to impress upon you here how
important this key step is.

###### THE TWO CORE TYPES OF CONGREGATIONS

As you’re building out your Dream 100 list, there are a few important notes
I want you to remember. In Secret #1, we talked about how there are two
ways that your dream customers will find you: either they’re going to
search for you or they’re going to interact with things that interest them
where _you_ will interrupt them. I make these same two distinctions when I’m
trying to identify where my dream customers are congregating.


**Interest-Based Congregations:** The first type of congregation is based on
interests. In most social networks, after someone joins, the first thing the
network tries to do is figure out what things you’re interested in. Facebook
is believed to automatically track over 52,000 data points on each user as
they are using their platform, which is super annoying as a user but super

awesome for us as advertisers.^8 On top of that, advertisers have the chance
to select the interests that people follow, such as:

```
Who are the people (influencers, celebrities, thought leaders, authors,
etc.) you are following?
What companies are you following?
What movies, books, and brands are you following?
```
On the Dream 100 worksheet, I put a column for each of the main social
networks. Depending on when you are reading this book, there may be new
networks that have become super popular and/or some of these networks
may be dead, so you should adjust the columns as needed. What matters
most is that you are making a list of all the people, companies, movements,
and interests that your Dream 100 are already following.
Start with your favorite social network and try to write down between 20
to 100 Dream 100 names for that network. Then do the same thing for
podcasts, blogs, email newsletters, and any other important types of
congregation. Although we call this the Dream 100, I like to try to make my
list as big as possible, and I re-create my list two to three times per year as I
pull off names that aren’t bringing us the right customers and add new
names as we find them.

After you’ve filled in as many names in the Dream 100 interest-based
columns as you can find, then move on to the search-based congregations.

**Search-Based Congregations:** When someone goes to Google or any other
search platform, they type in a keyword phrase looking for something like:

```
how to lose weight
```
```
emergency plumber Boise Idaho
```

```
best water filters
```
As soon as they type a phrase, they enter an existing congregation of
people searching for the same thing. Before I created my first product (How
to Make a Potato Gun), one of the first things I searched for was how many
people were currently searching for phrases around that topic.

```
potato gun
```
```
spud guns
```
```
potato launchers
```
```
potato gun plans
```
At that time, there were over 18,000 people per month searching for all
these phrases. Of course, that was a while ago, so the number has probably
increased dramatically. In my case, this congregation of people were
looking for something that I had the solution for.

This type of congregation is called a search-based congregation, and
searches can occur on Google, Yahoo, or any other search platform. Some
popular search platforms at the time of this writing are Quora.com, where
people can ask questions on any topic; Pinterest.com, where people search
for images; and YouTube.com, where people search for almost everything!
(Later on, I’ll show you how YouTube and a few other search platforms
serve as both search _and_ interest-based congregations.)

###### EXERCISE

To create your Dream 100 list, write out the phrases that you believe people
are actively searching. There will be many ways that we will refine and use
these congregations, from buying ads to doing SEO to getting those
people’s pages that are listed to push people into your funnels for you, but,
for now, just build a list from your best guesses. We’ll discuss some
amazing software tools later to help you identify phrases you might never


have thought of on your own, and we’ll also explore how to find out how
many people are searching for each phrase. For this exercise, though, I want
you to write out the phrases offhand that you think either you or your dream
customers would search for each day.

###### WHERE DO I START?

I’ve found that most people can grasp the concept of the Dream 100 pretty
quickly, but when they try to actually find 100 people, they get stuck.
Oftentimes they are able to build a dream dozen, but they struggle to get
more than that.

At the end of the day, traffic is a numbers game. I want to find 100 (or
more) people because even with 100 people, we may only get 5 to 10 of
them who are willing to let us get in front of their audience for free. After
that, we may only get 10 or so others for whom we’re able to successfully
target their audiences on the ad networks, so it’s essential that you cast a
wide net.
The easiest way to build a larger list is to go back to Secret #3 in _Expert
Secrets_ , where we explore the 3 Core Markets or Desires. I’ll quickly re-
explain it here so you can see how it ties into the Dream 100.

It starts with the 3 Core Markets or Desires: health, wealth, and
relationships.

```
image
```
```
Figure 2.3: Inside of the 3 Core Markets/Desires are submarkets and niches.
```
Each of the three markets have an unlimited number of submarkets. For
example:

```
Wealth → finance, investing, real estate, sales, marketing
Health → nutrition, strength training, weight loss
Relationships → marriage advice, dating advice, love
```

Inside each of the submarkets are the niches. So, for example, if my
market is wealth, my submarket would be marketing, and the niche that I
would create is “sales funnels.”

```
Wealth → marketing → sales funnels
```
Other niches inside of the marketing submarket could be marketing
through e-commerce, Amazon, dropshipping, SEO, PPC (pay per click),
Facebook Ads, or online courses. Honestly, other niches in my submarket
would include any way that someone would use the internet to market or
create a new business.

```
image
```
```
Figure 2.4: To find your best Dream 100, look outside of your niche and into your submarket
for the warmest traffic.
```
With that in mind, when I build my Dream 100, I’m not just looking for
other people who are selling “sales funnels” stuff. I do add those people,
companies, and keywords to my list, but what I’m really looking for is all
the other people, companies, and keywords that are within my submarket.
They are my warmest traffic and where I focus first.

My goal is to provide my Dream 100’s followers with my new
opportunity. I can usually build my Dream 100 from this list pretty easily.
But if you’re struggling to identify all the niches within your submarket,
just ask yourself this question: **What other vehicles are people trying to
use to (insert result they desire) with (insert your submarket here)?** To
illustrate this even further, let me give you some real-world examples.

```
In the WEALTH core market with a real estate submarket, I’d ask:
“What other vehicles are people trying to use to make money inside
the real estate submarket?” The answers to these questions would
include: house flipping, short sales, and wholesaling.
In the HEALTH core market with a weight-loss submarket, I’d ask:
“What other vehicles are people trying to use to get six-pack abs inside
```

```
the weight loss submarket?” The answers to these questions would
include: Keto diet, vegan diet, meatatarian diet, and bodybuilding.
In the RELATIONSHIPS core market with a parenting submarket,
I’d ask: “What other vehicles are people trying to use to have a better
relationship with their kids inside the parenting submarket?” The
answers to these questions would include: homeschooling, baby sign
language, after-school sporting programs, and drama.
```
Each of these answers is a niche within a submarket with dozens of
influencers, companies, and keywords that you can target! Your submarket
is where you should focus all of your Dream 100 efforts initially because
this is your _warmest_ traffic.

After you’ve finished filling in your Dream 100 worksheet, then you’ll
be ready to discover the Hook, Story, Offer framework that you’ll be using
over and over again to pull people from your Dream 100 into your funnels.


# SECRET #3

## HOOK, STORY, OFFER, AND THE

## ATTRACTIVE CHARACTER

```
image
```
**Figure 3.1: Every piece of good marketing has a hook, a story, and an
offer.**

It was 9:27 P.M., and the last of Jessica’s kids had just fallen asleep. It had
been a long day that started way before the sun came up, and it was finally
ending. While Jessica was exhausted, it was _her_ time now, as she had a few
precious moments to herself without kids pulling her in a million
directions. Soon she would have to start her nighttime routine of cleaning
up the house, getting herself ready for bed, taking off her makeup, and
finally falling asleep for a few hours, before she had to wake up and start it
all over again.

As she fell onto the couch, she reached into her pocket and slowly pulled
out her phone. _What’s been happening in everyone else’s life today?_ she
wondered. She opened Facebook and swiped through the lives of her
friends and family, hoping to find some comfort knowing she wasn’t the
only one who had a busy day.

Soon she started to get bored. But when she was about to close the app, she
saw an image fly past her screen. She almost missed it, but she slowly
moved her finger back up her phone, bringing the picture into the middle of
the screen.

Yep, she thought she saw that right. It was a picture of a woman about her
age in workout clothes, with gray shorts on. The thing that caught her eye
wasn’t the shorts, though—it was the dark gray spot in the middle of the
shorts. A little confused, she looked above the image and read the words:


Let me tell you about that time I peed my pants during a workout... I was
filming for Dollar Workout Club and I have never been so embarrassed
before.

Jessica was right! It was a picture of a grown woman who had peed per
pants! She laughed for a second, but then that laughter turned into
uneasiness as she realized that she knew exactly how this woman had felt.
She had experienced the same thing earlier that year when her kids had
wanted her to jump on the trampoline with them. She wanted to be a good
mom, but after a few jumps she had to get off because she had peed her
pants. She had quickly come up with a reason why she couldn’t jump
anymore, and after apologizing to her kids, she had run into the house to
get changed. She knew the story she had told her kids wasn’t true, which
added to her mom guilt even more. This also made her think about other
activities that she knew she would love to do but were off limits for the
same reasons.

After a few seconds of looking at the image, Jessica decided that she
wanted to see why in the world this woman would post a picture of herself
on Facebook telling others that she had peed her pants. She clicked on the
image and was immediately taken to a page that had a video from the same
woman in the picture.

Jessica clicked on the video and started listening to the story. The woman’s
name was Natalie Hodson, and she was a fitness blogger and mom of two
amazing kids who were both 10-pound babies. Natalie told her
embarrassing story of when she accidentally peed her pants during a
workout she was filming for her blog! She then talked about a doctor that
she had met who specialized in helping women with this problem. She
shared how this doctor was able to help her, and after she had success, she
wanted to share it with other women.

Natalie mentioned she had worked with the doctor to create an online
program that anyone could do from home with simple exercises to
strengthen their abs, core, and pelvic floor. Together, Natalie and the doctor
made an e-book that also came with bonuses like diet and nutrition tips,
exercises and movements, and specific training programs. They wanted to
make this offer for all the moms who had struggled with accidental leaks


after having babies, but didn’t have the ability to meet with the doctor in
person. Instead, you could get the same advice without ever leaving the
comfort of your home. And you could get the e-book and all of the bonuses
mentioned for just $47.

Excited, Jessica jumped off the couch and ran across the room to find her
credit card. After typing in her credit card numbers, within minutes, she
had access to the e-book that would solve her problem forever.

Even though Jessica’s story is fictional, this type of experience does happen
each and every day to women who are embarrassed when they accidentally
pee their pants a little bit when they cough, sneeze, or even jump on a
trampoline. Over the past three years, over 120,000 women have purchased
Natalie’s e-book. This has made Natalie Hodson a household name, given
her the ability to change the lives of countless women around the world,
and made her very wealthy in the process.

The framework that Natalie used to get over 120,000 people to buy her
book _Abs, Core, and Pelvic Floor_ is called Hook, Story, Offer.

The hook is the image and the headline that Jessica saw as she was
scrolling through her feed. It hooked her and stopped her just long enough
to get her attention. It then asked Jessica to click on a link, which gave
Natalie a moment to tell her story, build a relationship with Jessica, and
explain the perceived value of the offer she would be making. Finally,
Natalie made her an irresistible offer that would help Jessica to get out of
pain and move toward pleasure. This Hook, Story, Offer framework is the
pattern that you’ll see over and over again in most ads and funnels online.

#### HOOK, STORY, OFFER

This framework of Hook, Story, Offer is something I talk about often. It’s
the core foundation for how we sell anything online. It’s how we diagnose
what’s not working in every funnel that we set up. If an ad isn’t working,
it’s always because of the hook, the story, or the offer. If a funnel isn’t
converting, it’s always because of the hook, the story, or the offer. It really


is that simple and probably the most important framework that I am
teaching you to master.

In _DotCom Secrets_ and _Expert Secrets_ , I spend multiple chapters talking
about Hook, Story, and Offer, where I fully explain how to make irresistible
offers and the frameworks we use for story selling. I will be talking about
Story and Offer in this chapter in relation to traffic and ads, but _Expert
Secrets_ is the definitive guide for mastering these concepts. With that said,
let’s jump into the Hook, Story, Offer framework.

**Hook:** Now that we know exactly where our dream customers are
congregating, our job is to throw hooks to them to see if we can grab their
attention. In the next secret we’ll be talking more about _how_ to do that, but
for right now, I want you to understand _what_ a hook is.

The hook is the thing that grabs someone’s attention so you can tell them a
story. You see thousands of hooks every day. Every email subject line is a
hook, trying to grab your attention for just a moment so you’ll read that
email. Every post, picture, and video you see in your feed on Facebook is a
hook that is trying to get you to engage so they can tell you a story and then
make you an offer. Every picture on Instagram, thumbnail on YouTube, and
headline on a blog is a hook designed to grab your attention. We see hooks
all the time, yet it’s hard to define exactly what they are. Are they words?
Yes, they can be. Are they images? Yes, they can be. Are they the
backgrounds of your videos? Or the goofy things you do in the first three
seconds to get someone to stop scrolling? The answer is yes. Anything that
grabs someone’s attention is a hook, and the better you get at creating it and
throwing it into your Dream 100’s congregations, the more attention you
will get.

I always picture my end customer sitting on the toilet or lying in bed, or
sitting on the couch in the moments of their day that they are alone, holding
their phone, scrolling through their feed on Facebook or Instagram. What
hooks can I throw out that will cause them to stop scrolling and listen long
enough to hear my story? Pay attention the next time you’re scrolling to
what hooks grab your attention. Why did you stop? Why did you click
play? What did the hook say, and how did it make you feel? Answering
these questions will help you to become amazing at developing hooks.


**Story:** After the hook grabs their attention, you now have a small window
to connect with them through story. There are two core goals from that
story that you are about to tell them.

```
The story will increase the value of the offer that you are about to
make. By telling the right story (or “epiphany bridge” stories,
mentioned in Expert Secrets ), you can show the perceived value of
what you’re selling and the story will create a desire for them to buy
now.
The story will build a connection with you as the Attractive Character
and your brand. Even if someone doesn’t buy something today, if they
connect with you, they will become your follower, and then your
customer, and eventually your raving fan. Your stories will help them
to build a relationship with your brand.
```
Your personality (or “your Attractive Character,” mentioned in _DotCom
Secrets_ ) is becoming more and more vital to the success of your traffic
campaigns. Anyone can throw up an ad and get someone to buy once, but if
you are willing to share your stories, build a connection with your
audience, and actually serve them instead of only selling them something,
they will continue to buy from you over and over again. They will become
your advocates and share your message and your ads with their friends.

**Offer:** The hook gets your customers’ attention, the story creates desire,
and the last step of every message, post, email, and video is the offer. The
offer doesn’t always mean asking people to buy something amazing,
although this is my favorite type of offer. The offer could be as small as
telling them if they “like this post” or “comment on my video” or
“subscribe to my podcast” or “join my list,” you’ll give them a special
thing in exchange. The better the offer is, the more likely someone is to do
the thing that you actually want them to do.

If people aren’t doing what you want them to do (joining your list, clicking
your ads, or buying your stuff), the simplest way to fix it is often to
increase the offer. For example, if I tell you that I’ll give you $1.00 if you
take out the trash, you may say no, because that effort isn’t worth $1.00 to
you. But if I increase the offer and tell you $10, you may say yes. If I


increase the offer to $1,000, that offer would be too good for almost anyone
to say no.

The same thing is true with your ads. If you hook someone, tell them a
story, and make them an offer and they still don’t buy, it’s likely that the
offer isn’t good enough for them. You may need to tell a better story to
increase the perceived value of the offer, or maybe you may need to make a
better offer. Add more bonuses, increase how much they get, make it sexier
—whatever they need for the offer to be irresistible.

```

```
**Figure 3.2: Every page of your funnel needs a hook, a story, and an
offer.**

Yes, each ad has a _hook_ (the image or video or headline that gets people to
stop scrolling), a _story_ (the thing that you show after you have people’s
attention) and an _offer_ (typically, what they are going to get if they click the
ad). If you can show customers what’s in it for them, you will have success
utilizing the strategies taught inside of _Traffic Secrets_.

If any of your traffic campaigns aren’t working, it’s _always_ the hook, the
story, or the offer. If the conversion on your landing page isn’t working, it’s
_always_ the hook, the story, or the offer. If the attendance to your webinar,
the close rate on your pitch, your upsell take rate, or your email open rate is
not working, it’s _always_ the hook, the story, or the offer. And if you want to
solve all these problems, create better hooks, tell better stories, and make
better offers.


##### SECRET #4

### WORK YOUR WAY IN, BUY YOUR WAY IN

It was just weeks before we were going to “officially” launch ClickFunnels.
com to the world. For the past 12 months, my cofounder Todd Dickerson
had spent almost every waking moment painstakingly writing tens of
thousands of lines of code. I had spent every last penny I had earned trying
to keep the doors of my little company open so we could feed our families,
all the while waiting for the launch of our new company that we believed
would change the world. It was almost go time.

With one month left, Todd and our other cofounder, Dylan Jones, flew to
Boise to grind out the last 10 percent of the code before we went live.
Fueled by Red Bulls and a fire to see their baby come to life, they would
code each night until 3:00 or 4:00 A.M., go back to their hotels for a short
nap, then be back to the office by 9:00 A.M. These were the days that I
would never forget.
As the “nontechnical” cofounder who had no skills in code, I wasn’t able
to help during these hack-a-thons, but I knew my role. When the cart
opened on launch day, I needed to have a pipeline of people waiting and
begging to sign up for their free trials. So while Todd and Dylan were
coding, I was working on the Dream 100. For every platform, I would
research and find the people who already had my dream customers, add
them to my list, and send them messages to introduce myself. My Dream
100 list grew into my Dream 200, then my Dream 500. By the time
ClickFunnels was ready to go live, it had become my Dream 736. I
remember looking at that list the day before the launch, thinking that these
people had already congregated my dream customers and already had
relationships with them. I just had to figure out ways to get my message in
front of these audiences.


Looking back, just five years since that moment, it’s amazing to see how
far we’ve come in such a short period of time. This morning, as I’m writing
this chapter, we just passed 100,648 active, monthly paying customers
using ClickFunnels. The majority of those members, my dream customers,
came from the followings of the 736 people that I identified as my Dream
100.

Now, if you skipped the exercise in Secret #2, please stop here to go back
and do it. It’s the key to filling your funnels with traffic. Remember, if you
hired me for a $100,000 consulting day, this is the very first thing I would
have you do. If you need help doing it, pretend you just wired me $100,000
and then go and do it. The reason I emphasize this so much is because I’ve
seen the companies that make eight and nine figures a year complete this
vital step.

###### STEP #1—DIG YOUR WELL BEFORE YOU’RE THIRSTY

Now you have your Dream 100, and they have your dream customers. The
next question you should be asking yourself is the same question I asked
myself: “How do I get my message in front of their audiences?”
The first key to the Dream 100 is that you need to dig your well _before_
you’re thirsty. In his networking book, _Dig Your Well Before You’re Thirsty_ ,
Harvey Mackay explains that if you want to build a business relationship
with someone that’s worthwhile, you have to start it before you’re ready to

make the deal.^9
The most common mistake that entrepreneurs make when they start their
Dream 100 is to wait to start building relationships with those people until
their product is ready. As soon as I identify someone as being part of my
Dream 100, I immediately start digging my well. I personally do this in a
few ways.

First, I subscribe to everything that my Dream 100 are publishing. If
they’re on your Dream 100, they probably publish on at least one, if not
many, different platforms. I’ll listen to their podcast, read their blog, watch
their stories on Instagram, and join their email newsletter because there will
likely be a time in the near future that I’ll have the chance to actually speak
to them. I’ve met people in the past who have somehow made it through all


of my gatekeepers and got a precious few minutes of my time, and I’ve
figured out within seconds that they didn’t know who I was and only cared
about what they thought I could do for them. These conversations never
turned into anything fruitful for either of us. To avoid that situation, do your
homework so that when your moment comes with your Dream 100 person,
you’re prepared to talk about _them_. Ask them questions about their life,
things they post, and topics they care about.

I also watch what my Dream 100 are publishing because, in the future, I
might be creating ads for these same people. If I know the things that an
individual member of my Dream 100 are saying to their followers, I can
model the same language patterns in my messages.
Usually, when I tell people to subscribe to everything, they kind of freak
out because they don’t want to join over 100 people’s email lists, subscribe
to over 100 podcasts, or follow over 100 influencers on Instagram. After all,
it would take several hours a day to manage that, right? But the truth is it
actually won’t.

For the email newsletters, I create a new email address that is set up
specifically for my Dream 100 campaign, and I use that new email address
to join everyone’s list. I make a filter that pushes each person’s emails
instantly into a folder so my inbox stays clean. That way, when I’m about to
call or message a certain person, I can log into that email account, click on
their folder, and quickly look at the last dozen or so emails and catch up on
what they are publishing.
I also only use my social apps (YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, etc.) for
two purposes: to produce and publish content, and to spy on my Dream 100.
I don’t use them to be “social,” because this is the fastest way to ruin your
life. Okay, not really, but seriously... from this point forward, you should
never look at yourself as a “consumer” of social media but as a “producer”
of it. You produce content and you pay close attention to what your Dream
100 is doing on each of those platforms. That’s it. Personally, I spend about
15 minutes twice a day quickly swiping through each app to keep my finger
on the pulse of my market, and then I close my phone down and get back to
producing.

After subscribing to my Dream 100’s content, I try to buy some of their
products. This allows me to see their funnels and what they’re selling on


their backend and get a good idea of what they are doing. We call this
process “funnel hacking,” where you go through their sales process to get
ideas of what is working in this market as well as being able to get on their
customer lists to see what types of things they send to their customers.
When you’re a customer, you can tell them why you love their products.
Few things build rapport better and faster than being able to tell someone
that you’re a happy customer.

```
The third and last thing I do is look for ways that I can serve my Dream
```
100. Remember, right now I’m not asking them to do anything for me. I’m
digging my well before I’m thirsty to see what I can offer them. One of the
best things I can do to help someone after buying their product or listening
to their podcast or reading their blog is to talk about it socially. I may make
a post on my Facebook wall or on my Instagram stories talking about an
awesome podcast I heard or product I bought, telling other people that they
should go buy it while tagging my Dream 100 person in the post. I’ve found
that this is one of the easiest things I do to get someone’s attention and
provide value to them, but it could be anything from sending them a gift to
creating videos or images that they could use for their own marketing.
    This process may seem like a lot of work—and it is—but it’s the
foundation for your entire company. Not only is it the foundation for getting
traffic, it’s also the best way to figure out your place in the market’s
ecosystem. What value do you have that you can provide to this market that
is different? What problems are being unsolved by the others in your Dream
100 that you are uniquely qualified to do? Seeing what your Dream 100 is
promising and trying to sell to your dream customers, what hooks they are
putting out, what offers they are making, and what beliefs your market has,
will become the best market research you could ever do to figure out what
the gaps are in the market and what offers you need to create.

As discussed, when we launched ClickFunnels, I had built a very large
Dream 100 list. My first goal was to dig my well before I was thirsty, which
is a key step to do before you “work your way in.” I started doing this
through four very strategic phases:

**Phase #1 (Day 1–14):** I started the process of following my Dream 100 by
subscribing and listening to the content they were pushing out. During my


twice-a-day, 15-minute social media binges, I would watch what each of my
Dream 100 were doing, and then I would look for things that resonated with
me. I would quickly comment on what they were publishing, sharing what I
thought was special, and looking for ways I could serve them.

**Phase #2 (Day 15–30):** I would then contact my Dream 100 (via email,
direct message, etc.) and open up a dialogue. My goal was _never_ to pitch
them anything during this time.

Currently, I conservatively get over 1,000 messages a day among all my
social platforms, and there are some huge red flags that keep me from
responding to people, as well as a few green lights that give me an open
door where I’ll actually respond.

```
Red Flag #1: Don’t send a templated message. So many times I see
the copy/paste emails that have been sent to 500 other “influencers”
that day, and these messages don’t get a response. Write each person a
personal message or don’t send anything at all.
Red Flag #2: Don’t tell me your story yet. There will be a day and
time that your Dream 100 will care about your story, but it’s not with
the first message. You telling them your story is them serving you, and
you have not built up the reciprocity yet. Serve first, or they will never
have a chance to serve you later.
```
Pretend like you are trying to date your Dream 100, because you kind of
are. Treat them right, and one good relationship can be worth millions of
dollars to you. But now that you’ve seen the red flags, let’s talk about some
of the green lights that make me want to respond.

```
Green Light #1: This isn’t the first time I’ve ever seen your face.
Most of your Dream 100 spend time publishing things they believe in,
and if you don’t think they read the comments on the things they
publish, you’re wrong. Make sure that they’ve seen your face actively
participating in meaningful ways in the discussions they create, so
when they see you pop in their inbox or as a direct message, they
recognize you. During this phase you are selling you to the Dream
```

```
100, not your product. If they don’t like you, they’ll never want to
know more about your product.
Green Light #2: They tell me how great I am. I know that sounds
shallow, but come on, there’s a reason we’re doing this. I personally
feel very uncomfortable when people give me direct praise, especially
in front of people, but I love reading it in comments or messages, and I
remember the people who tell me how what I’m doing has impacted
them.
Green Light #3: They’ve done their homework. They know who I
am and what I care about, so when we do talk, they ask me about stuff
that’s important to me. When people ask me about my wife or kids or
wrestling or things that I’m really passionate about, I relate to them
differently and I remember who they are.
Green Light #4: They don’t ask for anything now. Just don’t do it.
Trust me. If you ask too early, the answer will always be no. There will
be a time, but that time is not now.
```
**Phase #3 (Day 31–60):** Make your Dream 100 your fan. I never ask
someone to promote something for me if they haven’t experienced it. When
we were launching ClickFunnels, I gave my Dream 100 free accounts, no
strings attached, so they could use the product. When I was launching my
books, I sent free copies. With my courses, I provided free access. Your best
promoters will always be your biggest fans.

After I have plugged into each person in my Dream 100 and started the
process of digging my well before I’m thirsty, there are now two ways that I
can get my message in front of my Dream 100’s audiences. First, I can
“work my way in” by getting traffic that I earn. Second, I can “buy my way
in” by getting traffic that I control. Let me show you how each of these
work.


```
Figure 4.1: You can get traffic from your Dream 100 by working your way in and/or buying
your way in.
```
###### STEP #2—WORK YOUR WAY IN (TRAFFIC THAT YOU EARN)

I want you to think about the last big blockbuster movie that you were
excited to see. Usually, it starts with a movie trailer getting leaked online.
From there, they start showing that trailer before all the other movies
leading up to the premiere. With all that marketing, I think that most of us
consumers are aware it’s happening. But then, usually about a week out
from the big day, the covert marketing strategy that pushes everyone to
watch the new movie on opening night begins. Hollywood knows that if
they don’t fill the theaters on launch day, then the sales for the life of the
movie will suffer, so they pull out the big guns.
What is Hollywood’s covert strategy? Well, it’s simply working their way
into the Dream 100 just like you do. Their strategy looks a little like this:


```
Figure 4.2: To launch a movie in Hollywood, the actors and actresses show up on various TV
shows to promote their movie.
```
Do you notice, what usually happens one week before a new movie or
TV series premiere, music album, or book launch? Where do the lead
actors, singers, or authors show up? They show up on TV! They put out a
hook to grab curiosity, tell a story to create desire, and make an offer to get
people out on opening night! That’s it! They have their Dream 100, and
they’re working their way in.

I was talking to Tony Robbins after his last book launch, and he said that
between TV, radio, and the internet, he did over 260 interviews during the
week he launched his book. While I’m sure that week was intense for him,
it helped him sell millions of copies of his books for free by allowing him to
work his way into the shows that had already congregated his dream
customers!
Now, while it’s easy for Hollywood to get booked on the daily talk
shows, oftentimes it’s harder for smaller entrepreneurs like us. The good
news is that you can utilize your Dream 100 in a way that is as powerful as
(and sometimes even more powerful than) being on the big, nationally
syndicated shows. These shows have a ton of people, but there is no
targeting at all. By using your Dream 100, you’re able to have your
interviews shown to the exact target market who is likely to buy your
product or service.


```
Figure 4.3: You can work your way in to your Dream 100 by appearing on their own shows.
```
When I launched _DotCom Secrets_ , I knew that I was going to spend a lot
of money on paid ads (i.e., buy my way into the Dream 100), but I also
wanted to get as much free initial traffic as possible. I started by sending a
pre-release copy of my book to everyone on my Dream 100, including
dozens of podcasters, bloggers, email list owners, and influencers. I wanted
them to read the book, and if they liked it, I hoped they would promote it to
their followings. A few days later, I sent them a certified letter in the mail (I
could have sent an email, but I wanted to make sure I got their attention)
telling them that if they liked the book, I would love to have them help
promote the book on the launch date. I’d even be willing to pay them $20
for every book they sold!

Almost instantly, I started getting responses from people on my Dream
100 list who had now read my book and wanted to help me promote it on
launch day! As I mentioned previously, one of the first to respond was John
Lee Dumas from the _Entrepreneur on Fire_ podcast! He said he loved the
book and would love to do an interview with me about the book and have it
go live on my launch day. We recorded an interview in the weeks leading
up to our launch, and on our book launch date, his podcast also went live.
From that one interview alone, we sold more than 500 copies of my new
book! And that result was from just one of my Dream 100! We ended up


getting dozens more people to help promote the book on their various
platforms. On opening week, we sold tens of thousands of copies, and that
book continues to be a bestseller to this day.

When we launched _Expert Secrets_ , I wanted to take that same strategy to
the next level. We took our Dream 100, and as soon as I had a cover
designed for the book, I sent them a copy of the book with 300 blank pages
inside. I hadn’t started writing it yet, but I wanted them to be aware that I
was writing another book. As I got closer to my launch date, I sent them a
copy of the book with the first four chapters in it (to help get them excited),
and as soon as I had the first, unedited draft, I sent them another copy. They
had a chance to see me create this book with them, and because of that,
many of them had a vested interest in its success.
We decided about a month before launch to coordinate a “virtual book
tour” just like the bigwigs in Hollywood would do if they were about to
launch a new movie. I asked each of the Dream 100 if they would interview
me on their platform, but we added a twist. I asked if they would add the
person who runs my Facebook Ads as a temporary user to their account so
that I could put in my credit card and spend my money to buy ads through
their ads account that pointed to the interview on their platform. Here is an
example of how this worked:

About a decade ago, one of the first people on my Dream 100 list was
Tony Robbins. To make a really long story short, I had the chance to meet
him in person during one of his Unleash the Power Within events. I then
went on to speak at his Business Mastery event in Fiji and was interviewed
for his _New Money Mastery_ DVD program. Yes, I had been digging my
well for over a decade. I had tried to serve however and whenever he asked.
And when _Expert Secrets_ was done, I decided that I was finally going to ask
Tony for something. I asked if he’d be willing to interview me about my
new book on his Facebook page.
Now this step is very important. I didn’t want to interview him on _my_
page, because then only my people would see it. If he interviewed me on
_his_ page, all of his (then) 3.2 million followers would see it! He agreed, and
the second that we started the interview, over 1,500 people watched _live_.
When the interview was over, I asked Tony if I could spend my money to
buy ads to that video through his profile and that I’d still pay him a $20


commission on every book he sold in addition to me covering the costs of
the ads. I tried to make this a huge _win_ for him, and he said, _“Yes!”_ During
our launch week, that interview was seen by Tony’s fans over _2.8 million_
times! Since then, it’s had a total of 3.1 million views. And that result was
from just one of my Dream 100.

```
Figure 4.4: By getting interviewed on Tony’s Facebook page, I was able to get in front of his
huge audience. This one video alone has been viewed over 3.1 million times!
```
I ended up doing a countless number of interviews on every platform
possible, and during launch week, we sold over 71,248 copies of _Expert
Secrets_! (The average _New York Times_ bestseller only sells about 10,000
copies during opening week.) This is how we “worked our way in” to the
audiences of our Dream 100.

Not all promotions are an interview, although I think that is the easiest
way to illustrate this concept. Many of my Dream 100 had an email list, and
they promoted my books to those lists by sending out an email
recommending purchase of the book. Some wrote reviews and posted it on
their blogs, while others talked about it inside their Instagram stories.
Everyone published to their own platforms in different ways, so I let them
do what was most comfortable to them. I will always be grateful to them for
putting me in front of their audiences: my dream customers!


Now, this concept isn’t just a launch strategy. It can and should be a
consistent part of your business. To this day, I still do multiple interviews
each month for people who have a platform that want to have me on as a
guest. I would recommend trying to do at least two per week as a starting
goal. This may seem like a lot, but it’s how you fill your funnels with
consistent leads. Usually at the end of the interview, the host will ask me
what I’m working on or where I would like people to go for more
information, and I direct them toward whatever funnel we are focusing on
at the time. Sometimes I will tell them to get a free copy of one of my
books, while other times it’s to get a free trial of ClickFunnels, download a
free report, or subscribe to my podcast.

This can and should be a consistent part of your traffic strategy. This
organic, earned traffic oftentimes converts at a much higher rate than almost
any form of paid traffic. It’s harder to scale, but your hottest, best buyers
will typically come from an endorsement from your Dream 100.
We call this “earned” traffic because you typically aren’t paying for it
with money, but you are paying for it with your time. When people are
getting started and don’t have an advertising budget, I always recommend
starting with earned traffic. The first eight years of my business were
entirely fueled by earned traffic. I worked my way into my Dream 100, got
in front of their audiences, and, with their endorsements, drove traffic into
my funnels.

For those of you who are starting with a big budget who think that you
can skip this part, I would be careful. I’ve found that paid traffic will get
you started more quickly, but the second you turn off the ads, the traffic
stops. On the other hand, when you have been constantly and consistently
working on earning traffic, your traffic will hit a point of critical mass
where you can’t turn it off even if you wanted to.


```
Figure 4.5: While controlled (paid) traffic usually produces a quick spike, the traffic typically
fizzles out. Earned traffic often produces a slower amount of traffic than paid traffic at first,
but usually grows over time.
```
In Section Two, I will be going deeper into each of the platforms that we
leverage, and I’ll show you more specifics on how to get this earned traffic.
For now, though, I just want you to understand the foundational concepts
behind earned traffic and how it works.

```
Now, let me transition into the next type of traffic: traffic you control.
```
###### STEP #3: BUY YOUR WAY IN (TRAFFIC THAT YOU CONTROL)


**Figure 4.6: While you’re building relationships with your Dream 100, you can still get traffic by
buying it.**

In a perfect world, every one of your Dream 100 would say _“Yes!”_ and
promote you to their audiences on all their platforms daily. You’d get
unlimited free traffic, you’d never have to risk any money on ads, and
business would be really easy. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way.
Typically, if I contact all of the 100 people on my list, I’ll usually get about
30 that will say yes, they will help, and then usually only about 10 people
will actually do any real promotion. Sometimes they’re too busy or get
caught at a bad time, while other times they might have a competing
product. Honestly, sometimes they may just look at you as their competitor
or maybe they just flat-out hate you, and that’s okay too. Just because you
can’t get them to promote you for free doesn’t mean you can’t still get in
front of their audience by running paid traffic. Yes, you can even get in
front of the audiences of the people who hate you.
However, when I got started over 15 years ago and I was trying to sell
my potato gun DVDs and other products I had created, this wasn’t an
option. You had to work your way in, and if the person who controlled the
traffic said no, you had no other options. But now thanks to Facebook and
now pretty much all social platforms, you can usually target the followings
of your Dream 100 and show ads directly to them. Yes, that means that
before Tony ever did the live interview and promoted _Expert Secrets_ on his
page, I had spent a decade buying ads on Facebook that only showed up to
his followers.

Now while I’m digging my well and building relationships with people,
at the same time I’m buying my way in to their audiences. I do this for a
few reasons.
First: It’s faster. Paid ads can give you immediate feedback. I can turn an
ad on and within minutes have people flooding into my funnels.

Second: It gives me the ability to test out different hooks and see what
things people in each of my Dream 100’s audience are clicking on. Before I
did the interview with Tony, we tested dozens of headlines and images and
ideas with his audience as ads and saw what things got the most clicks and
engagements. Then, when I had the opportunity to be interviewed by Tony,


I knew what his people actually wanted to hear and I could craft my
message around that.

Third: 90 percent of my Dream 100 will likely never actively promote
me on their own, but I still want to get in front of their audiences, and this is
the only way. It’s not as powerful as an endorsed promotion, but it’s the
second-best thing.
Fourth: Paid ads are how you scale a company fast. My number-one goal
with every funnel I create is to have a “breakeven” funnel, where for each
$1 we put into paid ads, we get at least $1 back. You see, this is the _big_
secret that I shared in _DotCom Secrets_ , which was proven with the launch
of ClickFunnels.

About a year after we launched ClickFunnels, we were approached by
the first big venture capitalist company who wanted to give us funding.
They had funded another Boise software startup and wanted to add another
hypergrowth company to their portfolio. I went to lunch with one of the
partners of the company to find out what they had in mind. As we started
eating, he started to ask me the questions that I had seen so many times
while watching _Shark Tank_.
“How much money does it cost you to acquire a customer?”
I smiled, knowing he wouldn’t understand my answer, and then said,
“Well, we were paying about $250 to get a free ClickFunnels trial, but we
turned those ads off.”
“Wait... what? That is a great CPA (cost per acquisition)! With those
numbers, if we were to give you $10 million, we could help add another
40K members. Not only would that make you worth a lot more, but we
could also take on another round of funding afterward!”

I stuttered a little, then explained, “We actually turned them off because
I’m paying for the ads out of my own pocket. I don’t have the luxury to go
$10 million in debt to get 40K members. Every customer I bring in needs to
be profitable from day one.”
Then I showed him the _DotCom Secrets_ book funnel and explained that
while it cost me about $23 on average in ads to sell a book, we actually
made over $37 on average from every person who bought the book.

“Wait... that makes no sense. How do you make $37 selling a free
book? You only charge $7.95 shipping and handling.”


```
Figure 4.7: When we create multiple buying opportunities for our customers in our funnel, we
usually break even or make a small profit on the front end. It allows us to scale without limits.
```
I laughed and said, “That’s the big secret of a funnel. People paid me
$7.95 for each book, but then we upsell our courses after they buy the
book.” I went on to explain the concepts further, as I’m about to do for you
right now. Because we can get lost in the weeds with numbers, I’ve broken
it down as simply as possible into the four steps a customer goes through.
Be sure to reference Figure 4.7 and read through this a few times until you
grasp how “average cart value” works.

```
The Product: We made $7.95 immediately from each person who
bought the book.
```
```
Total cart value: $7.95
I spent $23 in ads to acquire a customer, which made for a
negative: -$15.05
```
```
Order Form Bump: On the order form, we had our first upsell for the
audio book and 20.8% of our buyers added the $37 product to their
order (otherwise known as a bump).
```

```
New money collected for each buyer: $37 x 20.8% = $7.70
Total average cart value: $7.95 + $7.70 = $15.65
I spent $23 in ads, which made for a negative: -$7.35
```
```
OTO #1: After the buyer’s order, they immediately see the first of our
two special upsells, which are also called one-time offers (OTOs). Our
first OTO was $97 for one of our online digital courses that helped
implement what they would learn in the book. This first OTO had
9.92% order conversion in a one-click upsell that allowed them to add
it to their order without having to re-enter their credit card information.
```
```
New money collected for each buyer: $97 x 9.92% = $9.62
Total average cart value: $15.65 + $9.62 = $25.27
I spent $23 in ads, and we finally made a profit: $2.27
```
```
OTO #2: Then we offered a second OTO selling a course on how to
get traffic into funnels for $297. This second OTO had 4.19% order
conversion using a one-click upsell.
```
```
New money collected for each buyer: $297 x 4.19% = $12.44
Total average cart value: $25.27 + $12.44 = $37.71
I spent $23 to get each customer, but with an average cart value of
$37.71 in sales, we made a net profit for each new buyer who
came into our funnel: $14.71
```
I continued, “So when you do the math and add up all the orders, we
averaged $37.71 in total sales for each book that was sold! We call that
number the average cart value, or ACV. After the customer bought the
book, we used a follow-up funnel via emails, retargeting, Messenger, and
other follow-up tools to introduce them to ClickFunnels over the next 90
days. Because we acquired the customer profitably with our funnel before
they were shown our software, we got a customer _first_ and made a profit
before we ever introduced them to our core product. That’s how we’ve been
growing so fast without any outside funding.”


```
Figure 4.8: By creating front-end offers, we’re able to acquire customers for free (and
sometimes for a profit), and then we introduce them to ClickFunnels.
```
He sat there for a minute and then stated, “If what you’re saying is true,
this will change business as we know it forever.”

I smiled and told him, “Yes, that is the message that I’ve been called to
bring to this world.”
You see, there are really only two ways to scale a company fast. The first
is to take on outside funding and then to use that money to either acquire
other companies or pay to acquire customers. However, this way is lazy and
inefficient, and I don’t recommend it. I liken this strategy to taking steroids
to win a bodybuilding contest. Yes, you won, but you cheated.

The better, smarter, and more efficient way to scale a business is to create
a funnel that is profitable and then to put as much money into paid ads as
possible. When you have a funnel that at least breaks even, then you don’t
have an advertising budget and you can spend as much money as you want
without it ever costing you anything to acquire customers.
I remember when we had this realization with ClickFunnels. We had
been buying ads into our funnels and slowly growing them. We went from
spending $100 per day to spending thousands per day, and our front-end,
break-even funnel that we were driving traffic to was making us money for
each new customer that came in our doors. Even better, a huge percentage
of those customers then joined ClickFunnels at $97 per month, meaning we
no longer had an advertising budget. As long as we watched the ads closely
and made sure that we didn’t buy ads in places that weren’t going to at least
break even, we could grow fast. Soon we were spending over $25,000 per
day and growing at a pace that no one had ever seen before.

You might still be asking yourself, “Which is better: controlled traffic or
earned traffic? Is it better to work your way in or buy your way in?” The


answer is, “ _Both_ are essential to the long-term success of your company.” If
you only focus on paid ads, you are left at the mercy of the networks that
allowed you to buy the ads. If and/or when Google or Facebook slaps or
snaps, you can lose the lifeblood of your company overnight. If you only
rely on earned traffic, you are completely relying on other people to get
your message out to the market.

While the blend of these two types of traffic is the key to building a solid
foundation for your company, there is still one other type of traffic that
trumps both earned and controlled traffic. Given the chance to have only
one, I’d always choose this third and last type of traffic: traffic that you
own.


##### SECRET #5

### TRAFFIC THAT YOU OWN

```
Figure 5.1: While traffic that you earn and traffic that you control is good, traffic that you own
is the best type of traffic to have.
```
_Those numbers couldn’t be right... could they?_ I thought. I did the math
again.
“If I had 10,000 people on my list, and I was selling a $50 product... if
just one percent of them bought a product from me.. .” I mumbled under
my breath. “One percent of 10,000 people was 100 people times $50.” Then
it hit me. _I’d make $5,000, right?_

_No, that can’t be right. Can it?_ I hadn’t made that much money so far this
year, let alone from sending one email. _But wait, what if I had 100,000
people and sold the same product? That would be $50K! And that was if
just one percent of the people I sent an email to actually bought a product
from me!
But what do the numbers look like if two percent buy? $100,000?_ Whoa!
_That’s more money than most people make in a year. I must be doing these
numbers wrong._ But even after running the numbers a second time, I came
up with the same result.


Then a new idea flew into my head and I was so excited that my hands
were literally shaking. The words that were in my head wouldn’t stay there
any longer and I actually started to say out loud, “Wait. This is from just
one campaign. What if I did that once per month... or once per week...
or even once per day? Is that even possible?”

Suddenly I realized that I was still in class, even though the bell had rung
15 minutes earlier. The teacher was gone, and most of the kids, outside of a
few people lingering, were talking about their plans for the weekend.
Luckily no one was close enough to hear what I was actually saying to
myself. I felt like I was just given something illegal, some type of insider
trading, where no matter how I did the math, as long as I focused on this
one thing, I was going to win.
I looked around at those few people still in the room just long enough to
see that no one was even aware that I was there, and I half smiled and
started writing again. As I was scratching numbers on the back of a pad of
paper, I had one of those experiences. You know what I’m talking about?
That feeling when you found something that was too good to be true, but no
matter how many ways you looked at it, you couldn’t disprove it?

I had stumbled upon the key that could change everything for me. I was
just trying to figure out how to play the game of online marketing when I
came across a short reply to a forum post online regarding if people were
really making money online or if it was all just a big scam.
I wish I knew who this author was so I could thank him for this insight.
While I can no longer find the original post, it went a little something like
this:

```
Every so often I hear the skeptics ask this question, and I always
smile because I know that they don’t understand how leverage works.
They’re used to working eight hours a day and getting paid for those
hours. If they want to make $100K per year, they have to make at least
$50 per hour, work 40 hours per week for at least 50 weeks per year.
When they hear about the “gurus” online making $100K in a weekend,
it doesn’t make any sense to them and they think it’s a scam, but it’s
actually quite simple.
```

```
When someone has spent the time to build a list of followers of
10,000, 100,000, or 1,000,000-plus people, they can send out an email
to that list selling a product. To make $100K, they only need a small
percentage of those people to buy the product, yet to someone working
for the hourly wage it would take them all year to earn that amount.
Recently I sent an email to my list of 32,000 subscribers and offered
them a chance to buy one of my $37 e-books. Of those 32,000 people,
only 232 of them decided to purchase (just 0.7%), but that put a quick
$8,584 into my pocket. That would have taken the skeptics more than
171 hours (at $50 per hour) to earn the same as I did from less than 15
minutes writing the email and sending it out to my list.
```
My heart was beating out of my chest. I needed a list, and I wanted it
now. I turned to Google and started searching for the how. The next few
days I learned all the secrets about how to send mass emails. I purchased
the software, got the computers set up (mass emails used to be sent directly
from a computer), and all that was left that I needed was a list of email
addresses to plug into the software and I’d be rich.

But where did people get these lists? I couldn’t understand that part of
the puzzle, so I went back to good ol’ Google for the answer. Within a few
searches, I found the honey pot: a website that would sell me a CD with
over 1 _million_ “spam-free email addresses.” I didn’t know how they got
them, but they guaranteed that they would be spam-free, so I was in. I sent
them the money and patiently waited for my CD to arrive.
Everything seemed so easy. Each step was falling into place! Why wasn’t
everyone doing this? Was I missing something?

I waited and waited for the means to test my theories, but the days turned
into weeks with nothing showing up. I emailed the company, asking them
when I’d get the CD, but I didn’t get a response back. Had I just fallen for a
scam? _Where was my list?_
And then it happened! After a long day at school, and an even longer day
at wrestling practice, I got home late, beat up and tired. My wife, Collette,
was working two jobs to support her jobless student athlete at the time, and
she was worn out too. I walked through the door and gave her a kiss. But
right before I sat on the couch for a few much-needed minutes of rest before


starting on my homework, I saw it! On the kitchen countertop was a
cardboard envelope, just big enough to hold a CD!

All of my tiredness disappeared, and excitement flooded into my body as
I ran over, ripped it open, and held in my hands the CD that would
guarantee my freedom! _One million_ names and email addresses of people
who wanted to send me money for cool stuff I was going to sell them! I
quickly started spewing out what I had written down a few weeks earlier to
try to explain to Collette what this thin disc meant to us.
“This has a _million_ people’s email addresses on it! If we send out an
email selling a $50 product and just one percent buys.. .” I grabbed a pad
of paper and calculated the math again. “One percent of 1 million people is
10,000 people! Ten thousand people times $50 is $500,000—a _half million
dollars_ !”

“What?” Collette asked.
“I know, half a million seems like a lot, so let’s say it’s just 10 percent of
that. That’s still $50K! That’s almost _double_ what we made last year from
_just one email_! We could literally send out emails every week!”

And then I dropped the bomb. “Collette, you should go and quit your job
tomorrow! There is no way this could fail. Even if just a fraction of that one
percent buy, we’re gonna be rich!”
My wife probably tried to talk sense into this husband of hers, but I don’t
remember much of what she said because I was too busy running to the
computer. I unplugged our phone line, plugged it into my modem in the
wall, and started writing the email. I wrote about an amazing product that I
had yet to create and ended the email with a “Buy Now” link to my
personal PayPal account. I loaded the email addresses in, where all I had to
do was click send.

I sat there for a few minutes, visualizing what was about to happen. I did
the math one last time in my head, and then I took a deep breath, smiled,
and clicked send.

```
0 of 1,000,000 emails sent...
```
```
1 of 1,000,000 emails sent...
```

```
5, 9, 21 of 1,000,000 emails sent!
```
It was going a lot slower than I expected, but knowing that $500K would
be in my PayPal account soon, I was okay waiting a little longer for it. With
that, we went to bed, and like a kid on Christmas Eve, I lay in bed dreaming
about how much money would be in my account by morning.
The next morning, I was woken up by my wife. At first, I was a little
groggy, but her getting ready for work reminded me that she was supposed
to quit today. That is, as long as we woke up rich! I needed to check our
sales! I ran to the computer and woke up the monitor.

```
6,423 of 1,000,000 emails sent.
```
_WHAT?!_ Only six thousand emails had been sent so far. This was
completely throwing off my calculations. Instead of sending a million
emails a day, it was going to take weeks to send a full million. As I was
rewriting my business plan in my head, Collette told me that she needed to
use the phone, and, for those of you who don’t remember dial-up modems,
that meant I had to pause the email, crawl under the desk, unplug the
modem, and re-plug in the phone.

Within seconds, the phone rang. I crawled out from under my desk,
almost hitting my head as I answered it.
“Hello,” I muttered.
_“What the #@%#^$@ are you doing?”_ exclaimed the stranger on the
other line. “In the past six hours, we’ve received over thirty spam
complaints from _your_ IP address, and we’re going to shut you down.”
_Wait... what?_ “Sir, you don’t understand. The people I’m emailing have
spam-free email addresses. They want me to send them emails. I purchased
the list of emails from—”

“Son, that’s the definition of spam!” he yelled.
My heart sank. I vaguely remember him talking about lawyers and fines,
but honestly I just wanted to get off the phone and hide.

```
After what seemed like forever, I hung up with a huge lump in my throat.
“Who was that?” Collette asked.
```

“Um, no one.” But then I blurted out, “Just promise me that you won’t
quit your job today, at least not yet.” Collette smiled, took the phone, and
turned to make her call.

I was so frustrated. I thought I had cracked the code. Other people were
emailing their lists, so why did I get in trouble when I sent emails to mine? I
grabbed my backpack and started the trek back to the college campus, but I
felt numb as I walked out the front door. Instead of going to class, I slipped
into the computer lab, just to see if anything had happened during the night.
I logged into my PayPal account with this question spinning through my
mind: _Of the 6,423 people who did get my email, had anyone bought?_
I waited for the loading screen... loading... loading... and then I saw
the dashboard. Every time I had logged into PayPal before, the balance
always had a big fat $0.00 next to it, but not this time! This time the number
was different! Seven sales made the most beautiful $70 I had ever seen!

It had worked! I was still a little confused, though. I knew that the way I
did it was _completely_ wrong and potentially illegal. But I _knew_ that there
had to be a right way to build a list that wouldn’t get me labeled as a
spammer.
And so the next step in my journey began. With the newfound hope that I
now had, I searched for legitimate list owners so I could see what they were
doing. I joined tons of lists and watched the process. What did they do to
get me to sign up? What emails did they send? Why did some emails make
me want to buy something, while others didn’t?

And then, something happened that I had never experienced before. All
on the same day, I got emails from dozens of these list owners about a guy
whom they called “the godfather of internet marketing” and how he was
retiring. I clicked on the emails and was taken to a long page telling the
story of Mark Joyner, who was one of the early pioneers of online
marketing who had made millions of dollars. He was selling off all his
intellectual property, along with a course of him teaching how he had built
his company so large so fast. In the course, he would reveal how he had
built email lists with millions of people and how he had some of the most
visited websites in the world.
I knew I had to buy this product no matter what it took. I had never felt
this way before. Something about the way he told his story and made his


offer was _so_ irresistible. For just $1,000, I would get access to everything
this man had ever created. I looked at that page for weeks until his
campaign was almost over and he was about to pull this offer offline
forever. The night before he was going to close it down, I lied in bed
knowing that on the other side of that $1,000 investment was the key to
helping me build a list. I didn’t sleep that night, not for one minute.

As the sun started to rise and I heard my wife waking up next to me, I
knew I had to ask her something, but I was scared. Every online venture
over the past 18 months that I had tried had failed. Just a few months
earlier, I had gotten our internet access shut off within hours of me telling
her she could quit her job. Yes, 23 “tests” in 18 months, all in an attempt to
make money online, had failed. We had no money to our name, I didn’t
have a job, and Collette was making a whopping $9.50 per hour at hers. I
was about to ask her to let me spend $1,000 we didn’t have on a hope and a
dream.
I did that math. It would take her 105 hours of working to earn that
money, and that was before taxes. We needed that money for food and rent
and everything else, but as she opened her eyes and I asked her to make a
sacrifice that I couldn’t, she smiled and asked, “Do you think this will be
the one that works?”

As I’m writing this now, I’m tearing up. I always say that you can only
be as successful as your spouse or significant other will allow you to be.
When Collette looked at me in that moment, I knew she believed in me,
even though I had no track record of success, and I’m so grateful that she
did. I told her that I felt that it was the key, and if I could figure out how to
build a list, then we would be free, and Mark Joyner was the man who was
going to teach us how.
She gave me a kiss, told me she believed in me, and, with that, I jumped
out of bed, ran to the computer, and pulled out our only credit card and
typed in the digits. Within seconds, it was done. A week later, I had the
course. What I had assumed at this point and what Mark Joyner taught me
were the same: the list is the key. That’s the big secret. It is the only real
asset in any company.

###### THE ONLY REAL SECRET TO BUSINESS: LIST BUILDING


When you look at the big online acquisitions, it’s interesting to see what the
companies are actually buying. In September 2005, eBay purchased Skype

for $2.6 billion.^10 At the time, eBay was one of the largest online sites and
their development team was arguably the best in the world. It would not
have been difficult for eBay to clone Skype and make a better product.
What Skype had that eBay wanted, though, was 54 million members in 225
countries and territories, increasing at a rate of 150,000 new users daily.
eBay was purchasing the list.
In more recent times, Facebook purchased Instagram (and its 30 million

users) for $1 billion.^11 Obviously, there are many reasons why Facebook
made the acquisition, including acquiring their development team and
gaining speed to market, but one of the main reasons was to obtain
Instagram’s member list.
We also see it in smaller, entrepreneurial-type companies. Your list is
your key to your current and future success online. This is the _best_ type of
traffic: traffic that you own. As of the time I’m writing this, I have 1.6
million entrepreneurs who are on my email lists, hundreds of thousands on
my Messenger lists, over a million following me on my social lists, and tens
of millions of people on my pixeled lists.

In fact, my _only_ goal with traffic that I control and traffic that I earn is to
convert it into traffic that I own. That’s what I learned from Mark Joyner.
When I’m buying ads, sure, I want to sell a product, but, more importantly,
I want to get those people on a list first. Because when I buy an ad, I’m
getting them to click once. When they join my lists, I can email them as
often as I like for free, instead of just getting them to click once. It’s the
same with traffic that I earn. I want to direct these people into funnels
where I get their information and get them on to my lists. That way I can
follow up with them over and over again.


```
Figure 5.2: With traffic I own, I can follow up with my leads and customers anytime I like.
```
That’s why the concept of the break-even funnel in Secret #4 is so vitally
important. All of the traffic I control and earn is always pushed into a front-
end funnel that will ask for the visitor to give me their email address,
subscribe to a Messenger list, or both. That way, I can convert them from
traffic that I control or earn into traffic that I own, where I can market to
them for free, over and over again.

The different funnel types here are covered in great detail in _DotCom
Secrets_ , but for now, I want to show you how we use these front-end
funnels to convert clicks into traffic that you own. In both traffic that I
control and traffic that I earn, I have some type of call to action, or CTA,
pushing customers into a front-end, break-even funnel. For example, at the
end of a podcast interview, I might use three different CTAs to get people
into my funnels:

With a lead funnel, you’re giving customers something for free in
exchange for their email address. We call the thing you are giving away for
free a “lead magnet,” because if you create something that is exciting for
your dream customers, it will attract those leads just like a magnet. You
don’t sell anything in this type of funnel, but once they’re on your list, the
follow-up funnels are where you’ll make your profit.

```

**If I’m using a free book funnel:** “I just finished my new book _Expert
Secrets_ , and I’d love to send everyone a free copy if you’ll just cover my
hard costs of shipping. Just go to ExpertSecrets.com and let me know where
to ship your copy today!”
With the book funnel, we give them an amazing deal to get a copy of my
book when they cover the shipping. I send them the book, and then the
upsells will cover my ad costs and hopefully make me a small profit. More
importantly, though, I create a customer to add to my lists.


```

```
**If I’m using a webinar funnel:** “I have a new web class coming up where
I’m showing a new secret funnel strategy that almost nobody knows about,
that once you understand, can take your business from ‘startup’ to ‘Two
Comma Club’ winner practically overnight. You can register for this free
web class at SecretFunnelStrategy.com.”

With the webinar funnel, I invite them to the web class. When they
register, they join my list. Then at the end of the web class, I make a special
offer which covers my ad spend and ideally makes me a profit. (Note: this
funnel and how to give the presentation is taught in great detail in _Expert
Secrets_ .)


```
Figure 5.5: My webinar funnel gives away a “secret funnel strategy” in a one-hour
presentation.
```
Do you see how this works? I earn my way onto a platform, and then my
offer at the end pushes customers into one of my front-end, break-even
funnels. Each of the funnels is created in such a way that there is value at
every step of it.

```
Figure 5.6: With all of my front-end end funnels, the goal is to break even so I can ascend my
customers up my value ladder, thereby making a profit.
```

With the traffic I control, the process I take leads through is similar.
However, unlike earned traffic where I would be getting in front of
audiences by getting on to someone else’s show, having someone send an
email to their list for me, or letting me guest post on their blog, with paid
traffic, I create and buy ads.

###### UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE OF YOUR LIST

It’s been said that on the low end, you should average about $1 per month
for each name on your list, and when I got started, that was true. When I
had 500 people on my list, I was making about $500 per month. As I grew,
these numbers held true for a while:

```
1,000 people on my list: $1,000 per month
10,000 people on my list: $10,000 per month
100,000 people on my list: $100,000 per month
```
But as I’ve gotten better at building a relationship with my lists, these
numbers have gone up dramatically. As a worst-case scenario, though, they
should follow these metrics. For example, if you know you want to make
$100,000 per year, make sure you are focused on getting at least 10,000
people on your list (10,000 people x $1 per month x 12 months =
$120,000). If you want to make $1 million per year, focus on getting
100,000 people on your list (100,000 people x $1 per month x 12 months =
$1,200,000).

Again, I want to note that these numbers change in every market. Most
local businesses may only have 500–1,000 people on their lists, but because
of their ability to build a better relationship with that list, they could be
making $50–$100 per name per month, whereas with some types of lists
(such as retargeting or social lists), you might only make $0.50 per name. I
suggest setting a benchmark of $1 per name per month and then trying to
beat it.
As a side note, if you think about traditional investments like real estate, I
see people all the time spend $250,000 on a rental house and hope that it
brings in a positive cash flow of $500 per month. Then they’ll take up to 30


years to pay off the mortgage (i.e., “break even”) while still having to deal
with broken toilets, tenants, and more.

List building is a completely different investment model. I might have to
pay anywhere from $1 to $5 per lead in Facebook. For this example, let’s
use the top number. If I paid $5 per lead and only spent $5,000, I would
generate 1,000 leads. If I averaged $1 per month per name, after five
months I would break even, and after that I would have a positive cash flow
of $1,000 per month.
Having a list has also saved me multiple times in my company.
Unfortunately, sometimes things happened that required me to get an influx
of money quickly or I would lose everything. Traditionally, if I wanted to
raise a quarter or half a million dollars in a weekend, it would be
impossible. Because I had a list, however, I could write a few emails, send
them to the list, and generate the needed revenue in days. Twice, my list has
kept me from inevitable bankruptcy when the market changed and my
business was failing. I created a new offer, sent it to the lists, and was able
to quickly pivot and recover.

You might be wondering, “Now that I’ve added someone to my list, how
does that grow my company?” Well, the answer is simple. Now that you
have created the _most valuable_ thing inside your company, you can then
direct your subscribers into “follow-up funnels.”


##### SECRET #6

### FOLLOW-UP FUNNELS

My mentor and friend David Frey wrote: “A study done by the Association
of Sales Executives revealed that 81 percent of all sales happens on or after
the fifth contact. If you’re a small business owner and you’re only doing
one or two follow-ups, imagine all the business you’re losing. Not
following up with your prospects and customers is the same as filling up

your bathtub without first putting the stopper in the drain!”^12
Some say that the “fortune is in the follow-up,” and I believe it’s true.
The way we follow up is to take the traffic that we now own and push them
through follow-up funnels.

Last year, I pulled the stats from four of our most successful front-end
funnels to demonstrate the power of driving people toward a break-even
funnel and then using follow-up funnels. Let me give you a breakdown of
what happened over a 30-day window. (Note: ACV stands for average cart
value, i.e., how much we made on average from each person after they
bought the front-end offer plus any upsells.)

```
Funnel #1: DotCom Secrets free + shipping book funnel
```
```
Leads generated: 5,410
Books sold: 2,395
Average cart value: $30.81
Total gross sales: $73,789.95
Ad spend: $69,026.31
Profit: $4,763.64
```

```
Funnel #2: 108 Split Tests book funnel
```
```
Leads generated: 2,013
Books sold: 1,357
Average cart value: $12.38
Total gross sales: $16,799.66
Ad spend: $13,813.57
Profit: $2,986.09
```
```
Funnel #3: “Perfect Webinar Secrets” free + shipping funnel
```
```
Leads generated: 1,605
Product sold: 760
Average cart value: $34.38
Total gross sales: $26,128.80
Ad spend: $22,359.94
Profit: $3,768.86
```
```
Funnel #4: Marketing in Your Car free + shipping MP3 player
funnel
```
```
Leads generated: 5,177
MP3 players sold: 1,765
Average cart value: $14.79
Total gross sales: $26,104.35
Ad spend: $23,205.25
Profit: $2,899.10
```
When you look at just these four “break-even” funnels during a 30-day
window, the total stats look like this:

```
Front-end revenue: $142,822.76
```

```
Front-end ad costs: $128,405.07
Total profit: $14,417.69
```
So while it looked like our company was doing about a million and a half
dollars a year in top-line revenue, it was only actually making a little over
$10,000 per month. From the outside, this looked like a failing business,
and it would have been if we didn’t understand the strategy behind traffic,
funnels, and the value ladder. But when you do understand those core
principles, then the stats look a little differently. This is how we looked at
those stats:

```
New leads added to my list (traffic that I own ): 14,205 people
How much I got paid to acquire those 14,205 people: $14,417.69
```
That’s right. I didn’t just get free leads, I actually got _paid_ over $1.00 for
each person who joined my list that month. After we plugged these leads
into my follow-up funnels, we ended up making a total of $16.49 in sales
from every $1 we made inside of our funnel within 30 days of each lead
joining.

```
Figure 6.1: With follow-up funnels, we were able to grow our profit from just $1 per customer
to $16.49 per customer in a 30-day period.
```
Yes, those 14,205 people ended up collectively spending $234,240.45
within 30 days inside our follow-up funnels, and all of that money was pure
profit because I didn’t have to pay Mark Zuckerberg over at Facebook or
Larry and Sergey at Google any of it. I wasn’t trying to control the traffic or


earn it; it was mine. Once someone is on my list, I can then send out follow-
up messages to them anytime I want for free because I now _own_ that traffic!

In my follow-up funnels, I sent those 14,205 people emails with free
videos to build a relationship with them. A few days later, I invited them to
come watch my webinar where I taught them how ClickFunnels worked to
grow as a company. Not all wanted to watch the web class, but 1,129 did
and registered for it. At the end of the web class, we sold a product for
$2,997, and 57 people bought it (grossing us $170,829). Over the rest of the
month, some signed up for the ClickFunnels trial, some bought other books,
and some bought courses and coaching. In the first 30 days, we multiplied
our profits by more than 16 times. When you look over the next 60, 90, 360
days and beyond, you’ll see that each lead can and should be worth
thousands of dollars to you, and if you can break even (or even make a little
profit) to generate that lead, you should do it all day every day.
VC-backed companies will go in the hole for 6–12 months or more to
generate a customer. That’s right, they sometimes don’t break even for over
a year, but they can do that because they’re burning someone else’s money.

###### THE SECRET TO QUICKLY GROW YOUR LIST WITH PAID ADS

Ideally, we break even in our initial funnel, but sometimes it might take us a
few days or weeks to break even using our follow-up funnels. Many times,
people will lose some money inside of their front-end funnels and not break
even immediately, and because of that they get scared and walk away from
it. If they looked closer at their numbers, though, they’d see that they might
have been just a few days away from breaking even and that they could still
have kept running ads to those funnels profitably, even at a loss. Let me
show you how this works.

Let’s say that you decide to buy Facebook Ads to a lead funnel that
doesn’t actually sell anything immediately. You’re just giving away a free
report of some type of lead magnet with a goal to generate a lead that you
can plug into your follow-up funnels. In this example, let’s say that you’re
spending $3.00 to generate each lead.


```
Figure 6.2: If all we had was a front-end funnel, we would lose money on every lead we
acquired.
```
As of right now, this funnel seems like it’s a dud, right? Well, without the
follow-up funnel, it would be. When someone joins my list, I’ll build a
relationship with them. I might send them a few emails making sure they’re
able to download the lead magnet I gave them for free, and I might even
send a video or an article helping them to get more value from the thing I
just offered them. At that point, I would still be $3.00 in the hole for each
lead, but I would be building a relationship with them, which means they
would be more likely to open my emails and buy things from me in the
future.


```
Figure 6.3: With a follow-up funnel in place, we’re able to continue the conversation with our
leads.
```
Here’s where the fun begins. The next set of emails in my follow-up
funnel would be focused on introducing them to the next funnel in my value
ladder. For this example, let’s say it was one of my free book funnels. I
would send them three emails inviting them to get a free copy of my book
when they cover shipping. Those who get a free copy will be taken through
that sales funnel, and I should make some profit from each book buyer. In
this example, on average, I would make $1.00 from each lead who went
through this second step. As of day six in this follow-up funnel, I would
still be -$1.50 in the hole.


```
Figure 6.4: When we offer our leads the opportunity to ascend our value ladder and buy our
book, we start recouping some of our ad spend.
```
The next step in the follow-up funnel would be to move them into one of
my higher ticket funnels. We call this “funnel stacking.” In this example,
the next thing I would invite them to is one of my web classes. I might send
a few more emails inviting them to register for the webinar. After they went
through that webinar sequence and I made an offer for one of my higher
ticket products, the average dollar per lead would increase past the $3.00 I
spent for the lead. At that point, I would break even and start making a
profit. That means within about a week of paying for that lead, I would be
in the black! Anything that those customers bought from me in the future
would be _pure profit_.

```
image
```
```
Figure 6.5: After we stack multiple funnels back-to-back in our follow-up funnels, we make a
profit.
```
Are you seeing how this works? Sometimes the break-even happens
inside of the initial front-end funnel, but other times it happens within the
follow-up funnel. As soon as I know that I break even on day X of my
follow-up funnel, then I go back and spend money to acquire customers,


knowing that I’ll have a return on that investment at an already established
point.

When I first started on my online journey, I heard Mike Litman say,
“Amateurs focus on the first sale.”^13 I didn’t really understand what that
meant until I started using follow-up funnels and realized that I could spend
way more money to acquire a customer than I initially believed. Dan
Kennedy once said, “Ultimately, the business that can spend the most to

acquire a customer wins.”^14 With good funnels and a strong follow-up
funnel, you can increase how much money you can spend to acquire a
customer.

###### MULTIDIMENSIONAL FOLLOW-UP FUNNELS

So far I have only talked about emails inside your follow-up funnels. In a
perfect world, everyone who got an email would read it and click on the
links inside. Unfortunately, with people’s attention spans today (down from
20 minutes in the ’90s to just seven seconds today!), a lot of the people you
send emails to will never actually open them. Some stats show that as much
as 87 percent of emails go unopened! You’re battling for attention every
time you send anything.
As the war for attention has grown, a lot of amazing tools have been
created that we can plug into our follow-up funnels to make sure people
actually see our message. My hope is that this list of tools will continue to
increase, but I’ll share with you the ones that I see as the most powerful
today.

**Retargeting:** The first, and one of my favorite tools to plug into my follow-
up funnels, is retargeting ads. We’ll go deep into our retargeting strategy in
Secret #9, but for now, I want you to be aware of what they are and how
they work. Have you ever been to a website, and then over the next few
weeks, it seems like they’re stalking you online? Everywhere you go, you
see their banner ads following you around? That is retargeting, and it’s one
of the most powerful ways to push someone through your follow-up funnels
and ascend them up your value ladder.


**Messenger:** In 2011, Facebook created their Messenger program which, for
many people, has replaced email as their favorite communication tool. You
can add Messenger subscriber boxes into your funnels and get people
joining your email list to also join your Messenger lists. This gives you the
ability to follow up with people through a different channel than email. It’s
a very powerful tool that has a much higher open rate than email. However,
because of the intimacy of people’s Messenger inboxes, I’ve found that
unlike email, where I can send email daily and not have many people upset,
with Messenger, I can only send one or two messages a week without losing
many subscribers. We strategically place Messenger messages within our
follow-up funnels to create a conversation about once or twice per week
with a goal to direct people back into a funnel or ascend them into the next
one.

**Text Messages:** We don’t normally try to get someone’s phone number on a
traditional landing page, because each new field traditionally lowers
conversions, but I do try to grab a phone number when people buy
something from us or when they register for a webinar. We can use text
broadcasts to make sure people don’t miss the webinar they’ve signed up
for, let them know the statuses of their orders, and help move them into the
next step in our value ladder.

There are always new communication tools being developed, but their
goal is the same: build a relationship with your subscriber and ascend them
through your value ladder.
Now that you see how follow-up funnels work, I want to spend a minute
on the psychology and sequencing of follow-up funnels.

###### THE 3 CLOSES: EMOTION, LOGIC, FEAR

As you have seen, we have a lot of tools that we can use to try to get
someone to buy from us. But what should go inside of each message?
We’ve found that the ones that give you the most leverage include messages
based on:

```
Emotion
```

```
Logic
Fear (urgency and scarcity)
```
```
image
```
```
Figure 6.6: Whenever you close someone, make sure to include in your message emotion, logic,
and fear.
```
The most powerful way to get someone to take action is by using
emotion. It’s often been said that people buy things emotionally and then try
to justify their purchase logically. If you’ve read _Expert Secrets_ , the entire
book is focused on story selling, which shows you how to tell stories to
break false beliefs and put people into an emotional state where they are
ready to change and ready to buy. This is the most powerful way to create
emotion in the minds of your visitors and get them to take action. That’s
why most of our ads lead with emotional stories. The lead of any sales
letter, the stories in my webinars, the first emails in our follow-up funnels,
and the first ads in my retargeting sequences always speak to people’s
emotions. This is where the majority of your sales will happen too.

For example, take this sketch of a very basic “free book”–style sales
page, like the one you may have seen before you purchased this book. The
top of the page has a headline that appeals to one’s emotions, a video telling
stories to get one emotionally interested in the product, and then an order
form for one to take action. Fifty percent of my sales will come
immediately from people who only see this top block and never scroll.
They’re my emotional buyers.

```
image
```
```
Figure 6.7: Every sales page we create has this same style because it addresses the emotion,
logic, and fear messages in the order required to create the sale.
```
The next 30 percent of buyers are a little bit harder to convince. They’re
the analytical buyers. They may have felt something emotionally, but they
need to be able to logically convince themselves that the purchase is right
for them. Often they’re afraid of what others will think if they buy it,


because they have a fear that their status will decrease if the product doesn’t
work for them. So under this top section of the page, I transition my
message to speak toward their logic. I explain why this is a good deal and
compare it to other investments they could make. I also let them know
about the money-back guarantee if it doesn’t work so they won’t risk a
decrease in status. Lastly, I try to use as much risk reversal as possible.

The last 20 percent of buyers aren’t as motivated by emotion or logic, but
they are motivated by a fear of missing out (FOMO). The only thing that
will get them to take the leap is for them to be afraid that you’re going to
take it away. Urgency comes from you giving them all the reasons why they
need to buy it now, and scarcity comes from all the reasons why this will be
gone soon. For this last group, I close almost every sales presentation, letter,
and sequence focusing on urgency and scarcity.
I just showed you how the process of Emotion **→** Logic **→** Fear works
on a landing page, but it also works inside of every follow-up funnel and
retargeting sequence.

```
image
```
```
Figure 6.8: We build emotion, logic, and fear messaging into our follow-up funnels to help our
audience purchase our products.
```
When someone joins a follow-up funnel, my first set of messages focuses
on the emotion as I tell stories of other people who have used the product
and share the hidden benefits. After a few days, I switch all my messaging
to logic, and then the last set of messages will switch to fear.

If I’m only sending out three emails in that step of the follow-up funnel,
then I have one for each of the three closes. If I have five emails, I might
spend the first three days on emotion, one day on logic, and one day on
urgency and scarcity. The number of messages matters less than making
sure you hit each of the closes, because each one will bring in a different
group of buyers.
As I make my transition to the next funnel in my follow-up funnel, I start
over with emotional story selling again and get people engaged about the
next funnel in the value ladder. This process is true in _every_ type of
messaging you put out. When your goal is to move people through a


process or funnel, every type of communication you send should start with
emotion, move to logic, and end with fear (urgency and scarcity).

###### FOLLOW-UP FUNNELS (SOAP OPERA SEQUENCES) VS.

###### BROADCASTS (DAILY SEINFELD EMAILS)

In _DotCom Secrets_ , I talk about the two types of communications I have
with people after they join my list: Soap Opera Sequences and Daily
Seinfeld Emails. I’ve found that a lot of people get confused on how those
types of communications work and how they tie into follow-up funnels, so I
wanted to spend a minute showing how these concepts fit together.

When someone first joins my list, I take them through a process called
the Soap Opera Sequence. We call it that because the emails aren’t stand-
alone messages, but instead we will use multiple emails to tell a story,
where each email hooks you to read the next email in a way that is similar
to how a good soap opera will use their storyline to pull you from episode
to episode. In these emails, we tell our readers a story that will build a
relationship and rapport. That way, they’ll be more likely to keep reading
our emails, clicking on our links, and buying our products.
The second type of communication is the Daily Seinfeld Emails that are
more similar to episodes of the Seinfeld show. Each email is a stand-alone
message that has a hook, tells a story, and then pushes back to your core
offer. We use these each day as we send a broadcast to our list with a goal
of getting them back into our funnels. Some people have thought that these
two ideas were opposing, and others have asked how they fit into the
follow-up funnel framework. The truth is they both work together inside of
your value ladder.

```
image
```
```
Figure 6.9: After a lead has gone through your entire Soap Opera Sequences for all your
funnels, then you can send them your Daily Seinfeld Emails.
```
When someone first joins your list, we plug them into a follow-up funnel.
Immediately, they’re put on a Soap Opera Sequence where we tell them


stories (providing an emotional close) and lead them through our follow-up
funnel. The first set of emails are all about building rapport. Readers
usually connect with your story (as you’re the Attractive Character in your
business) because you’re the one who will likely be communicating with
them.

Then we transition to the first funnel we’re going to promote in our
sequence. We start “Season Two” of our Soap Opera Sequence (SOS) with
the stories behind the new product/funnel that we’re introducing them to.
We transition the SOS from us (the Attractive Character) to the first product
we want to introduce. The SOS moves through emotion, logic, and fear, and
it guides people into and through that first funnel. When it’s over, we move
to “season three” of our SOS and start our new story about the new
product/funnel that we’re introducing them to.
The Daily Seinfeld Emails come _after_ someone has moved through all
the Soap Opera Sequences inside of the value ladder and they are done with
our follow-up funnels. In a perfect world, we’d have follow-up funnels that
lasted 40 years, but the reality is that most good follow-up funnels are
effective for 30–60 days. After that, people drop off the core list that has
ascended your people through your value ladder, and then they’re moved to
our daily broadcast list. This is the list that we use to send our daily story-
based (Seinfeld) emails to lead people to our new front-end offers and get
them to re-register for our webinars and promote our blog posts, podcast
episodes, and affiliate offers. This is the bucket we put people into after
they have dropped out of the back end of our follow-up funnel.

The next secret will show you how to infiltrate your Dream 100, build
your own distribution network (your own show), and find your voice.


# SECRET #7

## INFILTRATING THE DREAM 100

From 1989 to 1994, there was a late-night talk show called _The Arsenio
Hall Show_. My parents didn’t watch it, so I never had a chance to watch it
at home. I do remember, though, that my friend’s parents watched it every
night, and often my best friend would tell me about it. One summer night
during a sleepover at their house, we stayed up late and I had my first
chance to see the famous Arsenio Hall in action, running around doing his
“Woof! Woof! Woof!” chant as he pumped his fist in circles. We used to
mimic this on the playground for years afterward every time we would
score a touchdown or a home run. His shtick became ours, and we thought
we were so cool every time we did it.

Over the years, I had a chance to see his show a few other times. I
remember being amazed at the energy of his show and the amazing guests
he’d bring on. In June 1992, he had Bill Clinton on while Clinton was
running for president. Clinton played “Heartbreak Hotel” on the
saxophone, an act considered by many to be the most important moment in
his political career for helping to build his popularity among minority and

younger voters.^15

Just two short years later, the show went off the air, and, for most of us, we
never heard Arsenio’s name again. That is, until 2012 when he showed up
as a contestant on _Celebrity Apprentice_. I watched that season, trying to
learn business lessons for growing my company from Donald Trump and
the contestants. Each of the episodes gave me a few ideas, but the biggest

gold nugget was dropped in episode seven.^16

It was so simple that I think almost everyone missed it. For some reason,
though, it caught my ears, and it’s been running through my mind now for
almost a decade. Let me set the scene for you. The two competing teams
were tasked with raising money for charity, and all the contestants were
making phone calls to their rich friends and asking for donations. Penn


Jillette was able to get the Blue Man Group to perform on the streets of
New York City and to donate money. Every celebrity was able to raise
some money, except for one: Arsenio Hall.

I watched as Arsenio opened his Rolodex of celebrities and made calls for
hours. Each call went to voicemail. He got one commitment from Jay Leno,
but the check showed up past the deadline and didn’t count toward the
competition. In the final scene before the boardroom, Arsenio’s frustrated
teammates tried to figure out why he didn’t raise any money.

Defeated, Arsenio explained that everyone used to answer his calls when he
had his own show. But when he didn’t have his own talk show, his so-
called friends avoided him.

And _that_ was the big takeaway! When you have your own show, everyone
answers your calls. Earlier we talked a lot about the Dream 100, and how
you can work your way in or buy your way in. In either of those situations,
you have more leverage when you have your own show, or your own
platform. When Arsenio had a talk show, if he called anyone (even the
future president of the United States), they would take the call because they
knew that he could provide a platform for them that they couldn’t get
otherwise.

Your platform is the true value that you have to provide your Dream 100.
It’s more valuable than money, gifts, or anything. The Dream 100 want
exposure, and your platform can provide that for them.

As cool of a person as I think I am, I’m sure that if I didn’t have my
platform of over 2 million entrepreneurs among my email lists, social lists,
and podcast listeners, it would have been very difficult to get Tony
Robbins, or any of my Dream 100, to return my calls, respond to my
emails, or be interested in working with me. None of these people needed
another friend. They did need, however, access to my platform, and so that
gave me the ability to get my foot in the door, build friendships, and start
partnerships. This is the key to working your way in.

Recently, I heard Gary Vaynerchuk speaking at an event for digital
marketers where someone asked him where the future of marketing and


attention is going. His response was very profound:

I think this [holding up his cell phone] is the television in 1965... And the
TVs, they’re the radio, right?... The one thing I do study is history,
because history loves to repeat itself. So, if you go look at the brands (the
beer brands) that were romantic about staying on the radio, because that’s
how they did it and didn’t shift to television, while things like Miller Lite
(that nobody had ever heard of) went TV only and became the brand.

If you look at TV in 1965, that’s what I think this [the cell phone] is, and I
think that YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat are ABC, NBC,
and CBS... And then I think I, within it, [am] _M*A*S*H*_ and _Happy
Days_. So that’s the system... And so what you need to do for your
business is figure out the channels where you could be the star of that

network.^17

```

```
**Figure 7.1: Find the “channel” where you can be the star, then build
your show there.**

As powerful as that statement is, the more powerful thing to understand is
that today you don’t have to convince a network that you should have your
own show. Instead, you can click a few buttons and _that fast_ you can have a
show on all the major apps.

Right now, the ABC, NBC, and CBS’s on people’s phones are:

```
Facebook (talk show)
Podcasts (radio)
YouTube (sitcom)
Instagram (reality TV)
Blogs (newspaper)
```
```
image
```
**Figure 7.2: All the previous forms of communication have modern-day
applications.**


More apps/channels will pop up, but as of right now, the majority of
eyeballs are focused on these apps, which each gives you the ability to
create your own show for free.

But is having your own show the same as having your own list? I would
say that the answer is, “Kind of.” With your own list, you own the traffic,
but with your own show, you’re renting space and trying to earn eyeballs
on someone else’s network. That was the problem for Arsenio. When Fox
dropped his show, it was over. If Facebook decides they don’t like your
show for some reason (and they’ve been known to do it), they can cancel
your show or your account without a warning. The same is true with
podcasts, Instagram, and YouTube.

Now, imagine if Arsenio Hall understood the principles you learned in
Secret #4, and if, during each episode of his show, he had told his viewers
to go to his funnel and opt in to get his top 100 favorite jokes for free. In
that case, he could have built a list of millions of subscribers on the
network’s dime, and when the show got canceled, he still would have had a
platform because he still would have had his list. He could have moved to a
new channel, launched a podcast or a blog, emailed his followers, and
guided his followers to his new show. Until you own the traffic, you’re
always left to the whims of the network. So even when starting your own
show, remember that the goal is still to turn that traffic that you’re earning
into traffic that you own.

#### YOUR PRIMARY DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL: EMAIL

The key to success with your show is how many people you can get to
actually consume what you’re creating. You might be able to rely on each
platform promoting you for free, but I never like to include that as part of
my marketing plans. Sometimes we’ll create an episode that goes viral and
we’ll get millions of views for free, but that’s not something we bank on.
Instead, we need to ask ourselves, “After my new episode is live, how can I
get people to go and consume it ASAP?” The best way to do that is to
leverage the list that you’ve already been building.

```
image
```

**Figure 7.3: The modern-day application of direct mail is email.**

We spend all our efforts to convert all traffic we control and traffic that we
earn into traffic that we own (our own list) because when we have our own
list, we control our own destiny. I’ve had friends who relied 100 percent on
Facebook or YouTube’s algorithms to promote their videos. A lot were
blessed with amazing reach, many of them getting tens of millions of views
for each video they would publish. Unfortunately, each platform’s
algorithms changed (as they always do), and many of these same people
now struggle to get a few hundred views. For that reason, I always look at
free, viral traffic as the gravy on top of what might come if I promote the
video to the best of my abilities, and I make my number-one goal first and
foremost to promote each episode I publish.

In addition to email, you’ll want to continue to build up other lists and
distribution channels, such as direct messenger lists on Facebook and
followers on Instagram, so you can do “swipe-ups.” Each platform has its
own version of a list, but email is the only one you own; you’re renting all
the rest and you could lose them at any time.

#### YOUR PRIMARY SHOW CHANNEL: TEXT, VIDEO, OR

#### AUDIO

The next logical question you might be asking yourself is, “Which channel
do I create my show on?” My response would be, “It depends on you.” To
begin with, you shouldn’t try to create a show on every channel. Doing that
will hurt your ability to grow at all. For now, the key is to focus on one
channel. In Secret #15, Conversation Domination, I’ll show you how to
leverage your primary show to get distribution across all channels, but, for
now, you need to focus on just two channels: your primary distribution
channel (email) and your primary show channel.

The channel you should be growing your primary show on depends on you,
your personality, and your talents. For those of you who love writing, I’d
focus on creating a blog.

```
image
```

**Figure 7.4: The modern-day application of newspapers is a blog.**

If you hate writing, but you _love_ the idea of being on video, then I’d
recommend you build your show on one of the video channels (each one
has a different strategy that we’ll go deeper into in the next section).

```
image
```
**Figure 7.5 The modern-day applications of sitcoms, talk shows, and
reality TV are respectively YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram.**

For those who have a voice for radio or who may be a little nervous about
being on camera, then I’d recommend starting your own podcast.

```
image
```
**Figure 7.6: The modern-day application of radio is a podcast.**

If you’re still not sure which platform you’d like to create your show on,
I’d recommend looking at which platform you consume the most content
on. Typically, if you love YouTube and spend a lot of time watching videos,
you’re going to have the best success creating videos for that platform,
because you understand it. If you listen to podcasts a lot, that’s probably the
best place to start. Similarly, if you read a lot of blogs, that’s probably the
best place to start.

Because we spent so much time talking about your “Primary Distribution”
channel (email) in Secret #7, I will spend the rest of this chapter talking
about your “Master Show.” Remember that for now, you should _only_ be
building one show on one channel. Do not try to build more than one at this
point. In Secret #15, I will show you how to leverage this one primary
channel into all the secondary channels, but that does not come now. Focus
all your efforts on making your first show successful.

**Figure 7.7: Once you have your primary show, you’ll use your
distribution channels like email, Messenger, and “swipe-ups” to notify**


**your audience there are new episodes.**

#### STARTING YOUR SHOW (FINDING YOUR VOICE)

On March 26, 2013, I launched my first episode of my _Marketing in Your
Car_ podcast, which later became the _Marketing Secrets_ show. It seemed as
good a day as any to launch it, outside of the fact that in the prior few
months I had almost bankrupted my company, fired about 100 employees,
found out that I owed over $250,000 to the IRS (which if I didn’t pay soon
would mean even more fines and possible jail time), and had almost no
money left in the bank account with tons of credit card debt piling up.
Looking back now, it seems like the worst possible time to have launched a
podcast teaching people my “secrets of marketing,” yet that’s exactly what
I did.

I knew that if I was going to do my own show, I had to be consistent or it
wouldn’t work. Out of all the types of shows that I could publish (audio,
video, or text), I knew that it had to be simple or I’d never stick to it. When
I considered how to work it into my everyday routine, I realized that every
day I had a 10-minute commute to my office. I figured that I could record
each episode on my phone as I drove to work. In the episodes, I would
share my thoughts about what I was doing to market my business and the
lessons I was learning each day. That’s how it got its original name:
_Marketing in Your Car_.

The first episodes were not good. In fact, years later, my friend Steve J
Larsen told me, “The first 45 or 46 episodes weren’t very good, but then
around that time is where it seemed like you found your voice, and they
started getting better and better after that.” The good news for me (and also
for you) is during your first episodes, the ones where you are the worst, no
one is listening to you yet! If I hadn’t done the first 45 episodes, I never
would have gotten to episode 46 where I started to hit my stride. That’s
why it’s so essential to start publishing your show now, even when you’re
not good at it. In the process of doing your show, you will find your voice. I
am so grateful that I actually had no idea how to check the download stats
to see if anyone was listening to me when I first got started, because I’m
sure that I would have been discouraged and stopped. Don’t look at your


stats, downloads, or numbers at first, because you’re just trying to build the
foundation for something great, and it will take time.

About three years into my podcast, I learned how to check the download
stats and discovered that I had tens of thousands of people listening to
every episode. I also found out that the majority of the people who had
joined my highest-level mastermind groups and coaching programs had all
been podcast listeners first. When I asked our coaching members about it,
the pattern of how most of them came into our higher-end programs was
shockingly similar. So many told me that they would listen to a few
episodes, and then for some reason, an episode would connect with them. It
made them want more, so they would go back to episode one and binge
listen to every episode over a week or two period of time. During the
episodes, I documented my journey as I was building back up my company.
I’d share stories of the people that I had a chance to work with; usually
before these listeners had finished binging, they had applied to work with
me.

Without selling ads in my podcast, promoting my own or other people’s
products (both things that you can and probably should do to make money
from your show), I was just telling stories of my own and from my clients.
Yet that podcast has converted more casual followers into raving fans than
anything else I’ve ever done. But it didn’t start that way; it took over three
years of consistent publishing.

Let me walk you through the steps that will make your own show a
success.

**Step #1) Publish daily for at least a year:** The first commitment that you
have to make is that you will be consistent. I knew when I started that if I
didn’t find a platform that was easy for me and easy to create the content, I
wouldn’t be consistent. What platform makes the most sense for you? How
and when are you going to publish? Do you wake up each morning and
write a 1,000-word blog post before lunch? Do you do a Facebook Live
before you go to bed each night sharing the day’s lessons? What works for
you that will help you to be consistent? If you can publish every day for a
year, you’ll never have to worry about money problems again. During the


process, you will find your voice, and your audience will have time to find
you.

One of my friends, Nathan Barry, wrote this post recently, “Endure Long
Enough to Get Noticed”:

How many great TV shows have you discovered in season three or later? I
started watching _Game of Thrones_ after they had released five seasons. Pat
Flynn had released at least 100 episodes of his podcast before I even knew
he existed. I discovered _Hardcore History_ years after Dan Carlin started
producing it.

This is such a common experience. There is so much content being
produced that we can’t possibly discover it all. So instead, we wait for the
best content to float to the surface after time. If step one in building an
audience is to create great content, step two is to endure long enough to get
noticed.

Seth Godin is very generous with his time and will appear on almost any
relevant podcast—but you have to have recorded at least 100 episodes first.
His filter is creators who have shown they are willing to show up

consistently for a long time.^18

For those of you who have been around me for any amount of time, you
know that this is a soapbox that I’m very firm on. You must be publishing
or you will never become relevant, and you must continue publishing if you
want to remain relevant. This part of the traffic flywheel does not go away.

Steve J Larsen knew when he bought his first tickets to Funnel Hacking
Live that I was probably going to tell everyone this eternal truth, but as he
packed his bags, he told his wife, “I will do everything that Russell says at
this event... except publishing my own show. I won’t do that.”

Before lunch on day one, I told everyone that the number-one thing they
could do from now until next year’s event would be to pick a channel and
publish daily on it. I told them that if they did that every day for a year,
they would never need to worry about money again. And then I did


something I hadn’t before; I made everyone in the audience commit to me
that they would start publishing that day.

Most of the people in the room raised their hands and were excited to take
the challenge, but very few took what I said at face value. But when one
person, Steve J Larsen, made the commitment, the one that he went in
knowing he wasn’t willing to make, he decided to go all in. He decided to
start a podcast, and at that event, he started creating his first episodes.

About a week later, he applied for a job at ClickFunnels and became my
new head funnel builder. He sat next to me every day for the next two
years. As I was working on my projects, he watched me share (publish) all
the lessons I was learning along the way. I was podcasting, posting on
Facebook, doing Periscope shows, and more. He told me that he was
shocked at how much I published, and so he modeled what I was doing.

For the next two years that he worked at ClickFunnels, he kept publishing
his show; after a few months it started getting some traction. It kept
growing over the years, and when he decided to make the jump from being
an employee to becoming his own entrepreneur, he had a large following of
people who were consuming everything he was publishing. That show and
his following became the launch pad he needed to launch his career. He had
the fans and a following, so he simply introduced them to the new offers he
had created, and he became an “overnight success.”

**Step #2) Document the journey:** The biggest question and the largest fear
that most people have when I tell them to start their own show is they have
no idea what they will talk about. One of the most powerful things I learned
from Gary Vaynerchuk is a concept he calls “Document, Don’t Create.” I’m
sharing an article from his blog going deeper into this concept:

If you want people to start listening to you, you have to show up. What I
mean by this is there are a lot of you out there who aren’t producing enough
articles or videos or pieces of content that should be produced to build your
influence. Too many “content creators” think that they only have one at bat
—they have to make the one, most beautifully created video or image or
rant on Facebook.


But what they don’t realize is that their hunger to make the perfect piece of
content is what’s actually crippling them.

It’s true that if you want to be seen or heard on social media, you have to
put out valuable content on a regular basis. You should be doing a YouTube
vlog or podcast or some sort of long-form audio/video series at least once a
week. You should be posting on Instagram and/or Snapchat stories at least
six to seven times a day.

Now you’re probably thinking, _Whoa, that’s a lot. How do I create six to
seven meaningful things a day?_

I’ll give you the biggest tip when it comes to content creation: Document.
Don’t create.

In very simple terms, “documenting” versus “creating” is what _The Real
World_ and _The Kardashians_ is to _Star Wars_ and _Friends_. And don’t get
confused—just because you’re “documenting” doesn’t mean you’re not
creating content. It’s just a version of creating that is predicated more on
practicality instead of having to think of stories or fantasy—something
that’s very hard for most people (including myself).

Think about it: you can ponder about the strategy behind every post and
fabricate yourself into this “influential person”... or you can just be
yourself.

Creating this influential persona might seem especially hard if you’re just
someone starting to climb the ladder. And I get it—for some of you there’s
a lot of pressure in that. You think that some 30- or 40- or 50-year-old is
going to listen to your rant video with cynicism and think, _What does this
kid know?_

But, one of the biggest mistakes people make when creating content for
their personal brand is trying to oversell themselves because they think
that’s what’s going to get people’s attention. Whether you’re a business
coach or motivational speaker or artist, I think it’s much more fruitful to
talk about your process than about the actual advice you “think” you should
be giving them.


Documenting your journey versus creating an image of yourself is the
difference between saying “You should.. .” versus “My intuition says.. .”
Get it? It changes everything. I believe that the people who are willing to
discuss their journeys instead of trying to front themselves as the “next big
thing” are going to win.

So, when I say to put out those six to seven meaningful pieces of content a
day, pick up your smartphone, open Facebook Live, and just start talking
about the things most important to you. Because in the end, the creative (or
how “beautiful” someone thinks your content is) is going to be subjective.
What’s not subjective is the fact that you need to start putting yourself out
there and keep swinging.

Starting is the most important part and the biggest hurdle that most people
are facing. They’re pondering and strategizing instead of making. They’re
debating what’s going to happen when they haven’t even looked at what’s
in front of them.

So do me a favor and start documenting.

“Okay, I started, Gary. Now what?” you ask. Keep doing it for another five

years and then come back to me before you ask again.^19

People who are tuning into your show are typically doing it because they’re
looking for some type of result. It’s the same reason why they buy your
products, open your emails, and engage with your content. People listen to
my podcasts, read my books, and watch my videos because they’re trying
to figure out more ways to market their business. I’m not publishing
because I know everything about this topic, I’m publishing because I’m
obsessed with this topic. I’m in a constant search for new and better ways
to market my own company, and as I run across them, have ideas, and read
cool things, I’m sharing them with my people. As my friend Rich Schefren
once told me, “We get paid a lot to think for other people.”

So my first question for you as you start your show is this: “What is the big
result that you’re obsessed with? What are you trying to learn for yourself
anyway that you can document as you’re discovering it in real time?”


```
image
```
**Figure 7.8: On your show, you can document your journey, test your
material, and find hooks.**

When you listen to the introduction to my podcast, I call out the big
question that I’m answering on my show:

So, the big question is this: “How are entrepreneurs like us, who didn’t
cheat and take on Venture Capital, who are spending money from our own
pockets, how do we market in a way that lets us get our products and
services and the things that we believe in, out to the world, yet still remain
profitable?” That is the question, and this podcast will give you the
answers. My name is Russell Brunson, and welcome to the _Marketing
Secrets_ podcast.

```
image
```
**Figure 7.9: In my podcast, I document my journey in real time.**

Inside of this frame, I can talk about, share, and interview people on
anything related to helping people sell more of the things that they believe
in. Since I started this podcast on the back of a huge business failure, most
people would have thought it was the worst time ever to start a podcast, let
alone one about marketing a business, but looking at it through the
“Document, Don’t Create” lens reveals that it was the perfect time to start
the podcast. In fact, I wish I would have started it 10 years earlier when I
had first gotten online, because I would have had so many more interesting
things to share as I was learning them all the first time. In any case, how
cool is it now, six years later, that I have documented the entire journey
from business failure to growing ClickFunnels to being an over $100-
million-per-year company? Even more importantly, tens of thousands of
people have been able to follow us on that journey and learn the lessons as
I was learning them!

**Step #3) Testing your material:** Recently, I was at a private mastermind
retreat in Wyoming with a handful of influencers who had collectively
made billions of dollars online and influenced hundreds of millions of


people. One night as we were sitting around a campfire, Dean Graziosi
shared an insight that has changed how I look at the material that I’m
publishing. His story, from the best of my memory, went something like
this:

You know how when you watch an amazing comedian perform onstage on
a late-night talk show, every joke he tells lands perfectly? You find yourself
wondering, “How is this guy so funny?” But what you don’t realize is that
over the last 10 years, as he started his journey to become a comedian, he
would write out 10 jokes, go to the closest dive bar, stand up on stage, and
deliver his jokes. He probably watched as one or two of the 10 jokes
landed, and the rest bombed. He would then go back home, take the two
jokes that landed, and then write eight new ones. The next week he would
find a new place to perform, deliver his 10 jokes, and maybe find that one
of his new jokes actually landed. Now he has three jokes in total that he can
use. He goes back to his apartment and starts the process over again, doing
this week after week, year after year, until he’s found his 10 jokes. Now
he’s ready. That’s when we get to see him, after he’s perfected the material,
when he stands up on stage, and lands every joke on the biggest stage in the
world.

I look back at my journey and think about my first book, _DotCom Secrets_. I
was so scared when I finished writing that book that I didn’t want to give it
to people to read. But what most people didn’t realize was that a full decade
before I wrote that book, I earned that book. I was obsessed with
marketing, and I read, watched, and listened to everything I could get my
hands on. After that, I would test the concepts and ideas on the little
businesses I was creating. I also tested the concepts on other people’s
businesses as a consultant. Some ideas worked, while others failed.

I started teaching at small seminars and workshops. I would explain
concepts and watch to see which ideas made sense to people and which
ideas were confusing. At each event, I would teach the concepts again, over
and over, tweaking and refining the ideas and stories every time. I did
interviews, podcasts, videos, and articles testing my materials over and
over again. From this work came the frameworks like the value ladder, the
secret formula, the three types of traffic, funnel hacking, and the Attractive


Character. I was testing my material for over a decade, and so while I was
nervous for others to read the book, I was also confident knowing that it
was ready.

The same thing happened with _Expert Secrets_. I spent two years talking
about the concepts on my own podcast and on other people’s podcasts. I
developed ideas on Periscope and then Facebook Live. I ran events,
workshops, and coaching programs testing the ideas on others’ businesses
as well as mine, and the end product was the book.

Today, as I’m typing this current book in the passenger seat of an RV while
my wife is driving and the kids are playing in the back, I’m just as nervous
about putting it out into the world as I was with my very first book. Yet I
know that I’ve been testing this material for the past two years on every
platform that I have had access to, and it’s ready.

Publishing your show daily, as you’re documenting your journey, will give
you a chance to start testing your material. You’ll discover what messages
connect with people, which episodes get shared, and which ones don’t.
You’ll see which messages get people to show up and comment and which
messages don’t connect. It’s this very process of you showing up
consistently and publishing that will help you to refine your message, find
your voice, and attract your dream customers to you. It doesn’t matter if
your end goal is a book, a webinar, a keynote presentation, a viral video, or
something else, the more you publish and test your material, the clearer
your message will become and the more people you will attract.

**Step #4) Introduction to Your Dream 100:** When you start your show,
typically you’ll use the first few episodes to tell your origin story, why you
created the show, and what people should expect. These initial episodes are
important because there will be people who find your show a week from
now, some a year from now, and others won’t find it for years, but when
they do, and when they get hooked, most people will go back to episode
one and binge-listen (or read or watch) to catch up on what they missed.
Even though these early episodes are old, they’ll still likely be a starting
point for many people that fall in love with your content.


After the initial episodes, it’s time to start using your show to infiltrate your
Dream 100. This is the secret to getting amazing new content for your
show, and it also gives you the ability to leverage your Dream 100 as guests
to grow your show.

```
image
```
**Figure 7.10: To grow your show, reach out to your Dream 100 to see if
you can be a guest on their show.**

Think about how this works on TV. Let’s say that _The Tonight Show_ wants
to get a lot of people to watch their show. What do they do? They try to
find the most relevant, interesting guests possible to be on the show, right?
But they don’t stop at that. All week leading up to that interview, they’re
promoting their guest on every distribution channel they have access to.
You’ll see commercials all week leading to the interview talking about
who’s going to be on the show, and you’ll see clips during the commercial
breaks leading up to the show, showing the funniest or most intense parts of
the interview. The host is leveraging the guest to attract more viewers. The
same will be true for your show.

Who are the people on your Dream 100 that have an interesting story they
could tell that will relate to your show _and_ have a following of people that
you can promote their episode to? You have a platform that you can now
leverage to get people on your show, and they have a network that you can
advertise their episode to. It’s a huge win-win. In a perfect world, they
would promote their episode to their entire following when it goes live (and
that does happen at times), but even if they don’t promote, you can still buy
ads targeting their audiences on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, or
wherever their following is.

Now, I know what you’re probably thinking, _That’s great, Russell, for
people who already have relationships with their Dream 100, but what
about me? I’m brand new. My show has almost no followers, so why would
any of them want to let me interview them?_ The reality is that many people
you ask will say no, and that’s okay, because you don’t need everyone. You
just need one: one guest that you can then leverage to get the others.


Typically, most markets have a “good ol’ boys” club atmosphere, and
usually a lot of your Dream 100 will be in one or more clubs. To infiltrate
and get access to that club, you don’t need to get access to all of them; you
just need to have one of the cool kids think you’re cool, and then you’re in.

One of my favorite illustrations of this point was in the movie _Never Been_

_Kissed_ , starring Drew Barrymore (Josie) and David Arquette (Rob).^20 In
this movie, Josie is a writer for the _Chicago Sun-Times_ and gets a job to go
undercover back to high school to get a story on teenage culture. She
struggles to get in with the cool kids, and her brother Rob tells her the
secret: If she can get one person to think she’s cool, then she’ll be in,
because everyone else at school will be too scared to challenge it. Rob then
demonstrates this principle as he registers for school, becomes popular
within a day, and uses his popularity to get Josie into the cool kids’ club.

A few years ago, I got a phone call from a guy named Tellman Knudson
who was just starting his own company. He knew I had a list of subscribers
(apparently I was on his Dream 100 list) and he wanted to ask if I would
promote a summit he was creating to my list. I decided the idea he was
pitching me on wasn’t a good fit, and I told him no.

I assumed this was going to be the last that I heard from him, thinking that
most of the people on his Dream 100 probably would have told him no as
well. He didn’t have a list or a platform; he just had an idea and some
hustle. About six months later, out of the blue, I started getting dozens of
emails from some of the most respected list owners in our industry, all
promoting Tellman’s new summit.

Interested in what happened, I gave Tellman a call and asked him how in
the world he was able to get all of these huge list owners to promote for
him.

He responded, “I made a list of the people I wanted to be part of this
promotion, and then I started calling them. The first person told me no, and
the second person said the same thing. I kept calling and kept getting noes.
Somewhere in that list I called you, and your answer was the same, but I
was determined to make this work no matter the cost, so I kept calling.”


“How many people did you end up calling?” I asked.

“Forty-nine.”

“You called forty-nine people?”

“No, I got forty-eight noes, but the forty-ninth person said yes! I knew that
after I had one yes, I was in. I asked him if he knew anyone else that might
be interested, and he gave me three names. I called each of them, and they
all said yes. I asked them for referrals, and they all said yes as well! As my
list of yeses grew, I started calling people who told me no and showed them
the people who were now involved and had said yes, and many of the noes
I had received earlier turned into yeses. I received forty-eight noes in a row,
and then the next thirty people all said yes.”

That promotion ended up building Tellman a list of over 100,000 people in
just a few short months, and that list generated him over $800,000 in sales
during his first year online. This is the power of infiltrating your Dream
100.

So your job now is to look at your Dream 100 and start asking them to be
on your show. Many will say no, but don’t let that stop you. You only need
one yes.

As you have a chance to interview your Dream 100 on your podcast, you’ll
be giving them a platform for which they’ll be grateful. You’ll be able to
spend time building a relationship as you interview them on your show
(digging your well before you’re thirsty), and you can tap into their
audience to promote their episode, build your show, and get access to their
followers.

#### PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

I’ve explained a lot of concepts in this chapter, so I want to recap it all into
something a little more tangible.

**Step #1:** The first step is to figure out what type of show you want to have.
If you’re a writer, then you should start a blog. If you like video, then you


should start a vlog on one of the video platforms. Lastly, if you like audio,
then you should start a podcast.

**Step #2:** Your show will be you documenting the process of achieving the
same goal that your audience will be striving for. As you’re documenting
your process, you’ll be testing your material and paying attention to the
things that people respond to. If you commit to publishing your show every
day for a year, you’ll have the ability to test your material and find your
voice, and your dream customers will be able to find you.

**Step #3:** You’ll leverage your Dream 100 by interviewing them on your
show. This will give you the ability to build relationships with them, give
them a platform, give you the ability to promote their episode on your show
to their audience, and get access to their friends and followers.

**Step #4:** Even though this is your own show, you’re renting time on
someone else’s network. It’s important that you don’t forget it and that you
focus on converting it into traffic that you own.

```

```
**Figure 7.11: As you create your own show, focus on converting traffic
that you earn and control into traffic that you own.**

And with that, I will close out Section One of this book. So far, we’ve
covered a lot of core principles to traffic. We:

```
Identified exactly who your dream client is.
Discovered exactly where they are congregating.
Talked about how to work your way into those audiences (traffic that
you earn) and how you buy your way into those audiences (traffic that
you control).
Learned how to take all the traffic that you earn and all the traffic that
you buy and turn it all into traffic that you own (building your list).
Discussed how to plug that list into a follow-up funnel so you can
move them through your value ladder.
Prepared to infiltrate your Dream 100, find your voice, and build your
following by creating your own show.
```

In the next section, we’ll shift our focus to mastering the pattern to get
traffic from any advertising networks (like Instagram, Facebook, Google,
and YouTube) and how to understand their algorithms so you can get
unlimited traffic and leads pouring into your funnels.


##### SECTION TWO

### FILL YOUR FUNNEL

In the first section of this book, we focused on truly understanding who
your dream customers are, finding out who has already congregated them,
and learning how to get access to those people and get them onto your lists.
In this section, we’ll be shifting more into the tactics of how to fill your
funnels with your dream customers on the following four advertising
platforms:

```
Instagram
Facebook
Google
YouTube
```
I could have gone deep into dozens of other platforms, including
LinkedIn, Snapchat, Pinterest, TikTok, and Twitch, but I’m only exploring
these four platforms in order to show you a framework and pattern that you
can learn and use on any platform that you’d like to get traffic from in the
future. Depending on when you’re reading this book, admittedly, some of
these platforms may no longer be relevant, and there will likely be many to
come that no one has even heard of yet.
Showing you the strategy and tactics on one platform is the equivalent of
“giving a man a fish,” and teaching you the framework to get traffic from
every platform is the equivalent of “teaching a man how to fish.” As you
read the following chapters, you’ll learn the pattern and see its practical
application throughout the four most important networks today, helping you


to master the frameworks that will fill your funnels with your dream
customers.

###### THE “FILL YOUR FUNNEL” FRAMEWORK

```
Figure 8.1: This quick sketch will help you remember the six steps inside the “Fill Your
Funnel” framework.
```
**Step #1—Understand the history and the goal of the new platform:** If
you want to know where the platform is going, you have to know where it
came from. How did Google start? Where did Facebook come from? How
did the algorithms change and, more importantly, why did they change?
What was the purpose behind them? If you can understand why they made
the changes, then you can start thinking like them. You can understand their
goals and intentions.
This is so important because by the time you are reading some of these
chapters, the algorithms may have already shifted, so it’s essential that you
understand the history so you can see where we are today.


As you start getting a layout of each platform’s history, you’ll quickly
start to see what their end goals are. Each platform has a goal to make the
best user experience for their end user as possible. That’s what keeps their
people coming back again and again. Google wants to make sure that they
give their users the best search results possible. Facebook wants to make
sure you love the things that show up in your feed. Once you understand
that creating the best user experience possible is their goal, then you can
start asking yourself how you can align with their goals. The goal of
spammers is always to hack the algorithm to get what they want, which
always provides short-term gains, because as soon as the spammers are
identified, the loopholes that they have been exploiting are taken away.
Instead, if you align with the wills of the network and give them what they
want, then they’ll give you what you want: tons of traffic.

**Step #2—Find and model your Dream 100:** The next question is, who on
this platform has already figured this out? Who has already identified your
dream customers, who is publishing to them, and who is getting rewarded
by the platform by getting tons of views or likes (or whatever the reward
system is for that network)?

As you start this part of the journey, I want to bring you back to the core
questions we asked in Section One.

```
Question #1: Who is your dream customer?
```
```
Question #2: Where are they congregating?
```
```
Asking these two questions should then get you to ask the next question:
```
**Question #3: Who are your Dream 100 on this platform who have
already congregated your dream customers?**

When I first went onto Facebook or Instagram (and I did the same things
on other networks like Twitter and LinkedIn), I looked to see the Dream
100 who had already mastered that platform. Who had the big followings
and tons of engagement with my dream customers? Then I built out a new
Dream 100 list specifically for each of those platforms, and I followed each


of them. I needed to be able to see exactly what they were doing, because if
they were having success, it meant that they were in the front of the
algorithm. They’re doing what the platform wants, so if you want to know
what the platform wants today, in real time, then you have to be watching
closely what they’re doing in real time.

```
Here are the three things it will take to funnel hack social algorithms:
```
```
1. Follow each of your Dream 100 and spend 10 minutes each day
watching what they are doing. Write down the answers to these
questions:
What are they posting?
How are they getting people to engage with what they post?
What paid ads are they running?
2. During these 10 minutes, try to comment, like, and engage with
as many things they are doing each day as possible.
3. Notice the pattern of what is working right now and model it for
your posts (funnel hacking). This will give you a pulse on what is
working in the market on that platform right now. It gives you
the ability to see in real time what the algorithms are
rewarding today.
```
Before we go further, though, I want to talk about modeling and funnel
hacking. Unfortunately, too many people will read what I wrote above, and,
if I’m not careful, they’ll start copying the inspirational quotes or videos
they see other people posting. Then they’ll come to me and say, “Russell, I
copied it like you said, and it’s not working.”

Funnel hacking is not copying. Funnel hacking is modeling, and there is
a big difference between copying and modeling. Every day, I look at over
100 people’s posts, videos, ads, and quotes, and that helps me to gather
inspiration for unique things that I can create. You’re looking for the types
of things the platforms’ algorithms are currently rewarding that you can
then model.
For example, a few years ago on Facebook, I noticed that some of the
people I follow in the fitness market had created what are now called


“memed videos,” where they added a headline in the actual video, usually
above and oftentimes below the video. They were new at the time, and not
many people were doing them. For some reason, though, that style and
layout got tons of views, comments, and shares—all of the things that we
know Facebook loves.

```
Figure 8.2: These memed videos got us a ton of comments, likes, and shares.
```
I saw this new pattern interrupt working, so we quickly modeled or
“funnel hacked” this concept and started making our own memed videos.
We were one of the first, if not the first, in the marketing world to use these.
Because no one had seen them, every video we published in this format got
more comments and engagement than anything I had ever seen before.
Soon, though, others noticed how well this pattern interrupt worked, and
they modeled it. Within a few months, hundreds of marketers were doing it,
and most of my feed was filled with memed videos.
When the pattern interrupt becomes the pattern, it stops being as
effective. Notice that I didn’t say they stop working; they just become less
effective. So if you are starting right now, and you see all of your Dream
100 doing something, you should still model what they’re doing. It may not
be as effective as a new pattern interrupt, but it is the current pattern that is
working, so that’s where you start.

After you model the pattern that’s working, the next phase of funnel
hacking the social algorithms is to look for and test ideas that will become
the next pattern interrupt. For example, a few weeks ago I noticed that some


of my Dream 100 started posting strange posts on Instagram that looked
like this:

**Figure 8.3: We realized that quote cards like these created a pattern interrupt for our audience.**

I had never seen anything like that before, and, honestly, I didn’t really
like it. It was different, though, so we decided to test the pattern interrupt
and see if it would work for us. I made my first post modeling this style,
and, sure enough, it was a winner. We now post images similar to this on
Instagram a few times per week, and we’ll continue to do that until we find
a new pattern interrupt that works better. Following your Dream 100 lets
you have your fingers on the pulse of what’s working currently in each
platform. You can model ideas that they’re trying, come up with your own
unique ideas, and test them both to see which ones stick.

Because the algorithms are always changing, it’s essential that you
network with and stay close to your Dream 100. They will be the ones who
will also have a vested interest in staying in front of the algorithm changes,
and it can be super useful to have a sounding board of people in your
market during the inevitable changes that will come.

**Step #3—Identify the publishing strategy and create your publishing
plan:** Each platform has multiple ways that you can publish your content,
so it’s essential to understand the strategy for each section and how you can
weave it into your daily publishing schedule. For example, Instagram lets


you do stories that are similar to a reality show, but you also have your
profile, which is more like a picture gallery. Questions I would start asking
myself are: “How often should you be doing Stories and what do you post
on your profile, and how often?” Instagram also lets you do “Lives” that are
similar to a talk show to your following and they have IGTV for your “how
to” content. There are a lot of possibilities, so you want to understand all
the publishing opportunities on each platform, decide which you want to
focus on, and figure out a plan to make it simple to consistently publish on
your chosen platform.

**Step #4—Work your way in:** After I start publishing on each platform and
I have content that my dream customers can see, I look for ways to work
my way into the Dream 100. I start asking myself the question, how can I
get organic, free exposure to the audiences of the people who have already
congregated my dream customers, and then get these people to join my lists
and become traffic that I own?

**Step #5—Buy your way in:** While I’m working my way in, I want to
stimulate growth as fast as possible. The best way is to buy ads targeting the
followers of my Dream 100 and then get these people to join my lists and
become traffic that I own. I discuss buying your way in to audiences
throughout this book, but Secret #9 goes a lot deeper to help you understand
the paid advertising frameworks that you can use to master paid ads on each
platform.

**Step #6—Fill your funnel:** As you’re publishing, working your way in,
and buying your way in, the goal is always to convert all the traffic and
attention into traffic that you own. You do that by pushing people into your
funnels where you can get their contact information, sell them your front-
end products, and then push them through a follow-up funnel to ascend
them up your value ladder.

These six steps make up the “Fill Your Funnel” framework and will help
you to master every platform and stay on top of what’s working in the
moment. I’ve taken a snapshot in time of how each of the following
platforms work and then applied this framework to them. That way, you can


see how I think, and then you can understand what I’m looking for as I
create my publishing plans and figure out how to work my way in and buy
my way in to the following of my Dream 100. My goal is to help make this
pattern so second nature to you that by the time you’re done reading, you
will know “how to fish.”


##### SECRET #8

### FILL YOUR FUNNEL ORGANICALLY

### (Working Your Way In)

It’s hard for most of us to remember, but it wasn’t too long ago that we used
the internet differently than how we use it today, back when there was no
social media. There were forums and message boards that allowed people to
share their thoughts and ideas, but, for the most part, we went online to
search for things we were looking for.
When the social movement started and sites like Friendster first popped
up, followed shortly thereafter by Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter, we
marketers all knew there was an opportunity to make money by leveraging
these platforms, but we didn’t know how. Most of our early attempts, if we
are completely honest, were us just posting links to our funnels and other
things that nowadays people would consider spam. We saw a huge
congregation of people, and we tried everything in our power to get our
messages in front of them. Most things we tried didn’t work, at least not
long-term.

I was frustrated with the new social platforms, thinking that they didn’t
work as a good vehicle to get traffic. Inevitably, I stopped trying to figure
them out for a few years altogether. Instead, I focused my energy on free
and paid search, banner ads, and email marketing, and I stayed away from
social media like it was the plague.
Around this time, Twitter started to make its big run. It became the fastest
growing new social network at the time, and everyone was jumping onto its
bandwagon. In fear of missing out on the next big trend, I jumped on and
started tweeting. At first, it made no sense to me, but all the cool kids were
doing it, so I tried. I grew my following, and then I did the only thing I


knew how to do as a marketer: I started to promote my products. To my
annoyance, not only did I make very few sales, but my marketing also
killed the engagement that I had built up with the few people who followed
me.

Then I watched as Perry Belcher, one of the people on my Dream 100,
joined Twitter. In a matter of months, he built a following of over 100,000
people, set up a webinar for those followers, registered over 20,000 people,
and made over a million dollars in sales from that one webinar!
I watched in awe as he did it, and so I did what any good funnel hacker
would do: I tried to reverse engineer his process. The more I dug into what
he was doing, the more confused I became. He wasn’t posting any ads. He
wasn’t talking about his products. Every post he made had thousands of
people commenting, sharing, and growing his brand for him.

I finally reached out to him and asked if he’d be willing to explain his
strategy to me. Luckily for me, he agreed. We quickly jumped on a phone
call together, and it went a little something like this:
“Hey, Perry,” I said. “I’ve been trying to figure out how to make money
with all this social networking stuff, and it’s not working. I see on the
outside what you’re doing, but it all seems backward. You’re not promoting
anything, you’re not selling anything, yet you’re making a ton of money.
What are you doing?”

Perry kind of laughed and said, “That’s your problem, Russell. Guess
how much money I try to make with social networking.”
“As much as possible?” I guessed.
I could hear him grin on the other end, and then he said, “Zero. None.
That’s how much I try to make with social networking. Social networking is
not about making money; it’s about making friends. It’s just like how we do
business in person. Let me show you how I view social media and how we
use it to grow our companies. If you look at the social networks, we have
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.... I view all of these networks like I’m
going to a party. So, if I’m on Twitter posting messages and responding, it’s
like I’m at a party. Does that make sense?”
“Um... kinda,” I replied. “But I’m still not sure how that makes us any
money.”


“Well, when you go to a party, do you just talk about what you do? ‘Hey,
I’m Perry, and I sell stuff. Would you like to buy some stuff from me?’ No,
of course not. If you did, you’d be the biggest jerk at the party. Everyone
would avoid you. And that’s what you’ve been doing on social media,
Russell. I’ve been watching you, and that’s why it’s not working for you.”

“Okay, then what do we talk about on the social networking sites? As an
introvert, I’ve never really networked in real life, so I’m not sure how or
what I should be saying.”
“You talk about what’s going on in your life,” Perry responded. “You talk
about your family, tell them stories, entertain them a little bit, ask them
questions, and introduce them to other cool people who are at the party.
Basically, you do everything you would do if you were hanging out with
them in real life. Social networking is just a great big party. That’s part
number one.”

I doodled an image to make sure it was clear in my mind. I also made a
note to watch how Perry and everyone else in my Dream 100 was posting
and making conversations on each social network so I could start modeling
these “party” interactions.

```
Figure 8.4: The goal of social networking is to invite people back to your home and, from there,
to introduce them into your funnels.
```
“The second part of the process is how I use my personal profile on each
social platform,” Perry continued. “My personal profile is my house, it’s my
home, it’s where I live. It has most of my thoughts, my information, and
stuff that is interesting to me. I archive pictures, videos, fun stuff I’ve done
with friends, and stuff like that. When people come into my house, they
know what I’m about. They can see the things that I like to talk about.”


“Now, this is how it works. When I go into groups and start networking,
or I see someone else’s posts in my feed, I go and participate in the
conversations and make friends. As they see me consistently show up, they
will want to drop by my house and see what I’m all about. Give them some
free stuff like chips and dip (free content) to get them to come to your
house. Then when they’re at my house, that’s where I invite them to take
action with me: register for my webinar, attend my next event, read my new
book, or join my newsletter list. That’s how I invite people from my house
into my funnels. Those selling conversations don’t have a place on social
media, but they do at your house. You can direct people into your funnels
from the posts you make on your own personal profile. If you provide value
on the social platforms, people will come running to your house because
they want more of you, and from there, they will flow into your funnels.”

This was the big “aha” that I needed! Social wasn’t about selling. It was
about making friends. I changed my tactics, deleted all my posts that were
trying to sell my products, and started serving, interacting, being
entertaining, and having fun with my followers. All the friends, fans, and
followers that came afterward were a direct by-product of me being the life
of the party.
I wanted to give you this context before we discussed any of the specific
networks, because this is how we “work our way in.” It’s the core concept
that you have to master if you want to have success with social media, no
matter which platform you are focusing on. Those who just spam their
message to their followers will always think that social media doesn’t work.
Even if they do get some short-term results, they won’t last. On the other
hand, those who play the longer game and plant seeds with their followers
will end up with a constant stream of traffic flooding into their funnels.

###### PRODUCER, NOT CONSUMER

I want to give you one quick warning because I know that some reading
this are probably already thinking, _Russell, I already spend way too much
time on social media right now. If I’m going to become the life of the party,
my whole life is going to be wasted on social media._


I’ll start by saying that yes, you are currently spending _way_ too much
time on social media. I don’t care who you are; you are probably already
spending way too much time consuming social media. If you’re spending
more than 10 minutes a day consuming social media, then you are wasting
your time. The keyword here is “consuming.”

As of today, you are no longer a consumer of social media. You are a
producer of social media. There is a big difference. Consuming social
media doesn’t serve you or the audience you’ve been called to serve.
Producing social media does serve them.
The first step in this process is to do a social media reset. That means
unfriending and unfollowing almost everyone on every platform that you’ll
be using to generate traffic. That way, you won’t be distracted by the
nonsense that everyone around you is posting. From here on out, you’ll use
social media as a business tool, not a social tool. After you unfriend
everyone, I suggest only following your Dream 100 on each platform. That
way, when you log in to any of the platforms, you’ll be able to quickly get a
glimpse of what they’re posting and get ideas for things that are working
well that you can model. Also, you will be able to start digging your well
with these people by commenting on their posts and messaging them
through direct messages.

Now that your social feed has been cleaned up, go and look for the social
parties that have the most people engaged in them. You wouldn’t go to a
party that only has a few dozen people; instead you would look for the
largest parties in town where you can get the most exposure for your efforts.
Depending on the platform, you’ll be looking for the largest groups,
podcasts, blogs, videos, and Fan Pages that you can go to and become the
life of the party. As you participate in these groups and serve their
audiences, the people will naturally start coming back to your home.
In the following secrets, I’ll be giving you a specific publishing plan for
each network that will show you how to effectively be a producer of social
media in a way that won’t consume your whole life. I want to bring up the
concept of producer versus consumer now so you will be able to look at
everything that happens in the next few chapters through this lens. This
way, you can focus on serving your audience, not wasting your precious
time.


Next we will cover how to fill your funnels with paid ads, and then we
will move into the two largest social networks at the moment: Instagram
and Facebook. I’ll discuss how to find your Dream 100 on both platforms,
understand the platforms’ strategies, create your publishing plan, grow your
followings and fill your funnels.


##### SECRET #9

### FILL YOUR FUNNEL WITH PAID ADS

### (Buying Your Way In)

Now that you’ve seen the overarching strategy for “working your way in”
and getting free organic traffic, I now want to lay out the strategy for how to
fill your funnel with paid ads. After you have an understanding of these two
core principles, then we’ll dive into each traffic platform (Instagram,
Facebook, Google, and YouTube) and show you how to use both of these
strategies to find your dream customers and bring them into your funnels.
As you can probably tell, I spend the majority of my personal time
working with my Dream 100, building and communicating with my lists,
and publishing content to build fans and followers. In fact, during the first
10 years of my companies, we didn’t run any paid ads. We paid affiliates to
promote our products and used a lot of the growth hacks that you’ll learn
about in Section Three, but we never actually paid for an ad.

We were able to drive a lot of traffic with these methods, but there was
never much consistency. We would set up a big promotion, drive a lot of
traffic, and make a bunch of sales. But after the promotion was over, our
traffic would slowly dry up, and we’d have to go back to the drawing board
and create the next new offer to promote. It was a traffic roller coaster that
lasted for years, until one day I decided I wanted off.
I came into the office and told our small team that we had to figure out
paid advertising so we could get off the traffic roller coaster and get more
consistency in our marketing. I asked if anyone was interested in diving in
and mastering Facebook and Google, and one person raised his hand and
said, _“Yes!”_


His name is John Parkes, and he started the first division of our company
focusing on paid ads. Initially, it was just him for a few years, and after he
figured out the model that worked for each network, he built a team that has
been the backbone for the growth of ClickFunnels to where it is today.

Adding paid ads into the strategies you’ve been learning about is like
adding lighter fluid to a pile of charcoal. You will get results faster on any
funnel you want to promote and be able to more predictably control sales
over the long-term.
Throughout this chapter, I’ll be quoting John in a few sections, but it
should be noted that everything I’m showing you here came from the
methodologies he pioneered within our company. As always, we’ll be
staying away from the exact tactics that often change and focus instead on
the overarching strategies that will help you to build out your paid traffic
plan.

One thing John told me as we were mapping out this chapter was: “While
it’s true that each advertising network has little intricacies and nuances that
can take a while to get used to, and there are definitely tips and tricks that
can incrementally improve your performance, the good news is that the
strategy of advertising on these networks is the same. The specifics of the
platforms can be learned with online tutorials, or they can be hired out, but
the strategy needs to be understood by you (the entrepreneur) in order to
succeed.”

###### WHAT IS MY ADVERTISING BUDGET?

The number-one question I get from people every time I start talking about
paid ads is always related to how much money they’ll need to budget to
actually run ads. I always smile and tell them that if they have been
following my advice so far and they’ve created a break-even funnel, then
every dollar that they spend in ads comes back to them immediately. If they
have a funnel that is break even or profitable, then they don’t have an
advertising budget. Their goal is to spend as much money profitably as
possible because each dollar they spend turns into more dollars.
Let me tell you a quick story to illustrate how this works. Recently we
launched a new front-end funnel at LeadFunnels.com. It was a $7 report


that had a $37 order form bump and a $100 “onetime offer” or OTO. After
the funnel was live, we wanted to test it to make sure it was working, that
there were no technical issues, and that it actually was going to be
profitable. So we created an initial “advertising budget” of $100. We started
running Facebook Ads, and within about a day, the $100 was spent.

We then looked at the sales to see if we had made at least $100. From our
first ad spend, we ended up getting about 100 clicks, selling 7 reports ($7 x
7 = $49), two people bought the order form bump ($37 x 2 = $74), and one
person bought the $100 OTO. The total sales equaled $223. After we
subtracted our $100 ad cost, we had made $123!
As you can see, this funnel no longer has an advertising budget. We’ll
keep running ads for as long as it stays profitable. If, for some reason, we
lost money on this test, we would turn off the ads, rework the funnel, and
then test again with another $100.

I never like putting very much of my money at risk at any given time, so
with each new funnel, as soon as it’s live, we set up a few ads, give it a
small test budget, and see what happens. The funnels that flop are sent back
to the drawing board to get reworked, and the funnels that work are scaled
to see how much money we can profitably spend.

###### PROSPECTING ADS VS. RETARGETING ADS

Before we start talking about ads, I need to take a minute to explain the
difference between “prospecting” ads vs. “retargeting” ads. Once you
understand the difference between them and how they work together, we’ll
dive deep into how to use each of them together.


```
Figure 9.1: To get your best results for paid ads, don’t stop with prospecting ads. Continue with
retargeting ads to give your warmer audience another opportunity to buy.
```
John explained, “Prospecting ads are the act of reaching out into the
networks to find cold traffic or people who aren’t familiar with you or your
offers and hook them long enough to get their attention. After we’ve gotten
their attention and gotten them to engage with us (engage could mean they
watched, liked, or commented on an ad), then we move them from the
‘prospecting’ pool into the ‘retargeting’ buckets. We then advertise to these
people differently and work to warm them up and then get them into our
value ladder.”
John continued, “Let me give you an example of how these work
together. Let’s say you have a book about effective parenting that you’d like
to sell. A prospecting ad would be one that you run to a specific group of
newlyweds who are likely new parents (or soon to be), introducing them to
concepts from your book. As people engage with those ads, you’ll be able
to see which people are interested in what you have to say. A small
percentage of those people may go and buy your book immediately, but the
majority of them won’t buy right then. It’s those people who have engaged,
but not purchased, who you would put into the retargeting buckets. Once
they’re in those buckets, we can warm them up, test other hooks, tell other
stories, and remind them of the great offer we’ve made them in order to
persuade them to click through and go into your funnel.”


###### STEP #1: CREATE LOTS OF PROSPECTING ADS TO “HOOK”

###### YOUR DREAM CUSTOMERS

When we first started using paid advertising, we made the mistake of
thinking that we needed to create a great ad, and if we got the ad right, it
would bring in thousands of our dream customers. I would spend a ton of
time trying to create the perfect hook, and then once we threw it out into the
ad networks, half the time it would fail. Other times it would work, but only
for a little while. It was frustrating because I had set my expectations
wrong. After a few months, we ended up with a few dozen ads that were
working, and then I shifted my focus to other things.

John would get frustrated with me and ask me to take more pictures or
make more videos that he could run as ads. I did a few every now and then,
but for the most part I just assumed that paid ads didn’t work as well as I
had hoped.
A few months later, I called up my friend Dean Graziosi and we started
sharing notes on what we were doing to sell our books and our coaching
programs online. I had known who Dean was since I was a teenager; after
all, I used to watch him on late night infomercials first selling his Motor
Millions product and later selling tons of different books on real estate. I
was probably the only kid my age who would sit up late at night and watch
Dean while taking notes in my notebook about _how_ he was pitching. I
know, I know, I’m such a nerd, but it was amazing to see how good he was!

As I started to grow my first company, Dean was one of the first people
on my Dream 100 list. I still remember that awkward moment when we first
met; I explained to him that when I was a teenager, I used to watch his
infomercials and study how he sold. He laughed, and we’ve grown a mutual
admiration for each other as we’ve gotten to know each other better. I have
become so grateful for times when we had a chance to just brainstorm on
what was working at the moment.
Once when I was speaking to Dean on the phone, I started to brag,
“We’re selling about 1,200 copies of our book each week through paid ads
right now.. .” But then I realized I didn’t know how many books he
himself was selling. “How about you guys?”


“We’re at about 5,000 a week right now and have been holding steady at
that number for the past few months,” he replied.

_Whoa, that’s more than four times what we’re selling,_ I thought.
Still talking to Dean on the phone, I shot a text to John to see what we
were doing wrong, and if he could tell if Dean was really selling that many.
A few minutes later I got a message back from John: “Five thousand?! I see
his ads everywhere, but there’s no way they’re buying more ads than us.
Ask him what he’s doing to sell that many.”

Dean and I talked for a while longer, but I still couldn’t identify how he
was getting four times the sales volume that we were. At the end of our call,
we decided that it was best for me to fly out to spend a day with Dean and
his team. That way, I could show them some of the cool funnel stuff we
were doing, and they’d show us deep behind the scenes of what they were
doing.
A few weeks later my team and I were in a plane, flying to Arizona,
excited to see if we could figure out how to multiply our book sales four
times over. Once both of our teams were gathered around a conference
table, we showed them our best stuff, and then they opened up and let us
look into their ad accounts.

At first, it was hard to find the needle in the haystack. Their ads looked
similar to ours, and the targeting looked similar too. It seemed we had the
same strategy... And then we saw it. Something we almost overlooked
and couldn’t have known at the time looking from the outside in. Dean and
his team were running four times more creative (ads) than us.
“How many ads are you guys running?” I asked.
“Lots,” Dean said. “They have me make a few new ads each day.”
_“Each day?”_
“Yeah. Through my day, I carry my book with me, and every time I find
a cool spot, I pull out my phone and make a new ad. Here is one at my
daughter’s softball game. Here is another at my house. This one is at the
airport, and this one is when I went out to dinner.”
I couldn’t believe this was the big secret. More creative. More hooks.
More ads. When you’re thinking about prospecting ads, you’re looking at a
huge ocean of people—all who need your product or service but all who
have a different reason why. If you try to create just one hook, it may last


for a while and grab the people who are looking for that hook, but it will
dry up very fast. You’ve got to become prolific at creating ads. The phone
in your pocket will become your ad-making, creative-generating, hook-
developing machine. Everywhere you go, you should be looking for
opportunities to record a pitch for your offers that you can then turn into
ads. After leaving Dean’s office that day, we learned the gold nugget we
needed to take our advertising and our company to the next level. My guess
is that if you’re reading this book, you probably saw one or more of the
hundreds of creatives I made with my phone selling this book and the entire
Secrets trilogy. You’ve probably seen the same thing with me selling
ClickFunnels, our coaching, and just about everything else that I’m part of.
The more creative you can put into the prospecting ocean, the more fish
(dream customers) you’re going to be able to pull out.

**Targeting for Prospecting Ads**

The next step after you have made your creative is to figure out who to
show it to. John explains:

```
Dream 100: The best place to start is your Dream 100 list for that
platform. When you’re running ads on Facebook and Instagram, you
can target people who have an interest in a certain thought leader,
brand, or celebrity. You’ll find many (but probably not all) of your
Dream 100’s followers targetable this way in the Ads Manager. For
YouTube, you can specify that you’d like your ads to show in front of
your Dream 100’s videos both individually or their channel as a whole.
Ideal customer avatar: Second on your targeting list is your ideal
customer avatar. Think about their interests, their age, their career,
their home life, and anything else you can identify. Most of these ad
platforms will allow you to get pretty specific on who you show your
ads to.
Overlapping sections of multiple audiences: Some ad networks let
you get more specific in targeting your audiences by layering on
multiple criteria and then just targeting the overlapping sections. Think
of three overlapping circles, each representing one of the audiences
above and then imagine a center area where they all overlap. This
```

center area represents the sweet spot where your dream customer is
most likely to be. An example of this would be to not just target Tony
Robbins’s followers in one campaign, business owners in another, and
women between the ages of 35–55 in a third campaign, but instead to
have one campaign that requires the viewers be in all three of those
categories in order to be shown your ad. Being smart with your
audiences and layering them can really help bring your costs down and
improve your results.

```
Figure 9.2: When you target overlapping sections of people, meaning you layer your
audiences and only target those who have multiple things in common, you can bring
down your ad costs and get better results.
```
**Algorithms:** The last thing, and honestly where the networks are
working toward, is for you to rely on the algorithms to do a lot of the
legwork for you. You see, once you have a few hundred people
engaging with your posts, clicking through to your funnels, and
becoming leads and buyers, you’ve generated a pool of data. You’ve
begun to prove exactly who it is that is responding to your advertising
efforts.


```
The platform algorithms can work with that data and actually start
lending a hand in your targeting efforts. In Google and YouTube,
they’re called Similar Audiences, and in Facebook and Instagram,
they’re called Lookalike Audiences. In both cases, you decide which
bucket to use as the source, the algorithm then looks deep into who
those people are, and then matches up others in your specified
geographical range who are most similar to them (and thus more likely
to care about what you have to offer).
```
**80/20 Rule for Prospecting**

One thing to note when running prospecting ads is that these types of ads
are the most expensive, but they are vital for two reasons. First, it’s through
prospecting that you find out who is actually responding to your ads so your
targeting becomes more on point (which brings your costs down). Second,
it’s prospecting that fills your retargeting buckets. If you stop prospecting,
you’ll soon find yourself with no one to retarget to. Here is a word of
warning from John before you start running your first prospecting ads:

```
I’ve been coaching small business owners and entrepreneurs for
many years on their paid traffic. One thing I consistently come up
against is a business owner who thinks it’s too expensive to make sales
using ads. If they’re too hasty, they’ll prematurely turn their
advertising campaigns off. I’ve found, though, that if they understand
how the 80/20 rule applies to ads, they’ll better know what to expect.
When you put up your first ads, they’re almost always going to a
colder audience, a group of people who don’t know you and don’t
know what you have to offer. It will always be more expensive and
less efficient to advertise to this crowd, but when you’re getting
started, you have no other choice. Results will come slower with these
prospecting efforts and costs to get a lead or a sale will be much higher
(sometimes even so high that you’re losing money to begin with). In
fact, don’t be surprised if you spend 80 percent of your advertising
budget in this category and it only generates 20 percent of your results.
But if you hold strong, there is a light at the end of this tunnel. You
see, while one purpose of the prospecting campaigns is to generate
```

```
some leads and sales upfront, the bigger purpose is to fill all your
retargeting audiences (which include your social followings and lists).
As people begin to engage with your ads, they may subscribe and
follow you (which you don’t have control over) as well as be added to
specific retargeting audiences (which you do have control over). It’s
from these new followers and retargeting audiences that you’ll often
see 80 percent of your results while only using 20 percent of your
budget. As you use both of these strategies in tandem, you can make
the sales you want at the cost you want and grow your business
effectively.
```
###### STEP #2: USE A RETARGETING FUNNEL TO CREATE

###### CUSTOMERS

As you’ve been spending money on prospecting ads to find your dream
customers, the cream off the top has probably already come and purchased
your products. However, there are so many people who would likely buy if
they just had a little extra nudge. In Secret #6, we talked about the power of
following up with your prospects through follow-up funnels using their
email address. But what about all of the people who watch your videos or
come to your funnel but don’t give you their email addresses? How do you
follow up with all of them? The answer is through retargeting ads.

```
Here’s an example from John to show you how this works.
```
```
Let’s say you spend $2,000 on ads.
From that, you get 100,000 people to actually see your ad.
The ad performed well and 4% of these people engage with the ad
(4,000 people).
And 2% of the original 100,000 click the link in the ad and go to your
funnel (2,000 clicks).
Of these people, 30% of them give you their email address (600 leads).
And 10% become buyers (60 buyers).
```

```
Figure 9.3: Through retargeting, you can reach those who didn’t buy when they first saw your
ad.
```
That leaves 3,940 people who engaged with your ad but didn’t become a
lead or a buyer. While you’ll never be able to capture everyone’s attention,
you can in fact reach a _lot_ more. How? This is where retargeting comes in.
Since your efforts to reach people only resulted in a tiny fraction buying,
you need specific campaigns in place to reach back out to those who were a
good fit but just didn’t take action (or enough action) for whatever reason.
In order to do this properly, you need to build custom audiences. There are
three specific audiences that are essential to a high-performance retargeting
plan. Each is based on how far viewers got along the customer journey.

**Audience #1—Engaged:** The first audience you’ll want to build is an
audience based on viewers having engaged with you. Did they watch your
YouTube videos this week? Did they watch one of your prospecting ads and
make a comment recently? These people interacted with your post but never


left the platform to pursue your offer. While they have made a minor
commitment to you, it’s nothing serious. These people are worth some
continued ad dollars but not too much or for too long. I tend to run an ad to
this audience for up to five days. If they haven’t visited my landing page by
that point, I let them fall out of the audience and return to the prospecting
pools from whence they came. Maybe I’ll hook them again in the future and
they’ll pop back into my retargeting bucket, or maybe I’ll never see them
again.

**Audience #2—Landed:** The second audience you’ll want to build is made
up of the people who clicked through and landed on your page. These
people took a bigger commitment, left the platform, and visited your sales
funnel. While they trusted you with their curiosity and visited your page,
they didn’t take any further action by opting in or purchasing. I tend to run
an ad to this audience for up to seven days trying to get them to come back
and take me up on my lead magnet. Again, if they don’t opt in or buy within
seven days, I just let them fall out of this audience.

**Audience #3—Owned:** The third type of audience you’ll want to have is
made up of those who did take your lead magnet and those who purchased.
These people have made a large commitment and have entrusted you with
email addresses and credit card numbers in exchange for your goods. This
is the traffic that you now own, and it becomes very useful and lucrative in
many different ways. Not only are they now on your follow-up funnel
sequences, but they’re also prime candidates for seeing ads for your next
offer or an offer one step up the value ladder.

```
Figure 9.4: The three types of audiences to include in your retargeting ad campaign include:
engaged audience, landed audience, and owned audience.
```

Unlike prospecting ads where I’m making new creative as often as possible,
with your retargeting campaigns, you’re focusing on creating them once
and you will never touch them again. It’s similar to a Soap Opera Sequence
inside of a follow-up funnel that you write once, and it lasts forever. As we
move people through the retargeting buckets, we use the same three closes
you learned about earlier: starting with emotion, then moving to logic, and
ending with fear (urgency/scarcity). That is how we pull people into action
throughout each retargeting campaign.

In order to implement retargeting, you have to place a pixel (a block of
tracking code) on your sales funnel. This is a simple copy/paste procedure
that allows the network to see how far along the customer journey your
viewer got. This is important for two reasons. First, it provides feedback for
you on what’s working and what’s not (what’s converting these prospects
into traffic that you own and what isn’t) so you can pivot in either your
targeting or your messaging. It also provides feedback for the algorithm to
learn and optimize advertising efforts along with you. Second, the pixel is
what allows us to put viewers into the different audience categories, so
we’ll know _when_ to put specific ads in front of them.
To summarize, effective retargeting has at least three audiences (engaged,
landed, and owned), and the end goals should be based on the type of
audience the ad is targeted to.

```
Engaged → Sell the click: Tell the network you want to collect a
custom audience of everyone who has interacted with your posts in the
past five days. To this audience, you want to show an ad with a hook
and story that sells the click.
Landed → Sell the opt-in or purchase: Tell the network you want to
collect a custom audience of everyone who has clicked through to your
landing page in the past seven days. To this audience, you want to
show an ad with a hook and story that sells the opt-in or purchase.
Owned → Sell the next step: Tell the network you want to collect a
custom audience of everyone who has converted into a lead and/or
sale. To this audience, you want to either offer another front-end
product or walk them up the next step on your value ladder.
```

To understand this better, think of people as moving on certain conveyor
belts. While they’re on a specific conveyor belt, they’re shown the ad
appropriate to them; you’re hoping they take the hook and find themselves
in a new audience on the subsequent conveyor belt. If they don’t take the
hook, they move off that particular belt and find themselves back in your
prospecting pool awaiting the next hook that intrigues them.

The lowest hanging fruit in the advertising world is running ads to your
subscribers, followers, and ever-growing lists that you own. And while only
a third of the emails you send may get opened, you can always run ads to
your lists, often reaching those who didn’t originally open the emails and
greatly increasing your overall conversions from these lists.
What I’ve outlined here is a very effective strategy that will work on
Google, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook as well as other ad platforms.
There are many different tactics and little things you can do to increase your
ads’ effectiveness, but by following the strategy outlined here, you can
always be sure that you’re hitting the right people at the right time with the
right message.


##### SECRET #10

### INSTAGRAM TRAFFIC SECRETS

Over the past few years, one of my favorite social platforms to spend my
personal time on has been Instagram. One of its core features, Instagram
Stories, has become my favorite way to document my daily journey.
Personally, I believe that it’s the most powerful of all social tools to build a
relationship between you (the Attractive Character) and your audience. A
lot of the strategy I learned originally when I set up my account was from
my friend and amazing entrepreneur Jenna Kutcher. In this chapter, with
Jenna’s permission, I’ll share many of the concepts we learned from her.
I’m so grateful to her for allowing me to share them with you.

###### STEP #1: UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY AND THE GOAL

Created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger in San Francisco, Instagram

launched on October 6, 2010.^21 Its fast-paced growth was unheard of:
100,000 members in the first week, 1 million members in the first two
months, and 10 million members in the first year.^22 And in June 2019, it

passed over a billion members!^23

In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stocks.^24
While that story is fascinating, I think the more exciting story occurred in
2013, when Mark Zuckerberg offered to buy Snapchat for $3 billion.^25
After Snapchat’s founder said no, Facebook decided that instead of buying
them, they would just try to beat Snapchat at their own game. Over the next
few years, they added all of Snapchat’s core features into Instagram. Then
in August 2016, they threw the death punch: they replaced Snapchat’s
signature feature by launching Instagram Stories. Soon Snapchat’s stocks


plummeted, users migrated in droves from Snapchat to Instagram, and,
almost overnight, Instagram became the second largest social networking
site in the world.

Mark Zuckerberg’s goal when acquiring Instagram and ripping off
Snapchat’s features was to find more places to leverage attention and place
ads where you are spending your time: looking at your feed, exploring
various things, and watching other people’s stories.
If you are “working your way in,” then you win this game by:

```
Attracting followers
Creating content that engages them and keeps them coming back to the
platform for more
```
As you do that, you can use that attention to get free, organic traffic into
your funnels.

If you are “buying your way in,” you win by showing your ads to your
Dream 100’s followers and pushing them into your funnels. As with all
platforms, I believe we should be playing both sides: working our way in
and buying our way in.

###### STEP #2: FIND YOUR DREAM 100 ON THIS PLATFORM

The first step, as you’ll soon see with every platform, is to identify the
Dream 100 that have already congregated your dream customers on the
platform you are starting on. Follow each of them and set up a plan to spend
a few minutes each day viewing all their Stories, posts, and ads. This will
help you to identify the patterns that are making these people successful.
Each day, I spend three to five minutes viewing my Dream 100’s posts
looking for:

```
What pictures “hook” me and make me want to read the caption
Which captions make me want to take an action
```
```
At the same time, I:
```

```
Like the posts from my Dream 100
Comment on at least 10 of my Dream 100’s posts each day (digging
my well)
```
I also spend five minutes watching Instagram Stories from my Dream
100:

```
Looking for cool ideas on ways they’re engaging people
Checking out where their swipe-ups push me to
Messaging (DM’ing) on at least 10 of their videos (digging my well)
Looking for the swipe-up ads that are shown to me and funnel hacking
them (swiping up on them)
```
Remember, you’re now a producer of social media, not a consumer.
Don’t get caught in the trap of following tons of interesting people who will
distract you and waste your time. Follow only those people who are already
successfully serving the market that you want to serve, so you can
understand what message they’re sharing. Then you can figure out your
unique angles inside of that ecosystem and unfriend or unfollow everyone
else.

###### STEP #3: IDENTIFY THE PUBLISHING STRATEGY AND CREATE

###### YOUR PUBLISHING PLAN

There are many ways to publish content on Instagram, and each section of
the platform has a different strategy for how to publish and how to
monetize. To make it simpler, I’ll break down each of the core sections in
Instagram and explain the strategy for how you can use each one. Here are
the core areas of the platform we’ll be focusing on.

The first I call “content hooks,” where you are producing images and
videos in a way to grab your dream customers and turn them into your
followers. We rarely, if ever, actually sell anything in this content; we only
focus on getting people to like, comment, and follow. We do this in two
sections in the app:


```
Instagram profile (your gallery)
Instagram TV (your produced video content)
```
The second section of the app is your home. This is where you’re able to
direct people into your funnels and actually sell. I’ll show you the strategies
behind how we sell in this chapter, but for now understand that the areas
that you’ll be able to sell your products and services are:

```
Instagram Stories (your reality show)
Instagram Live (your live show)
```
Again, I want to mention that these platforms, their features, and the
strategies for them are always evolving, so view this chapter as a baseline,
and watch your Dream 100 closely so you can model and innovate on any
and all algorithm changes as they come.

```
Figure 10.1: On Instagram, you have two different ways to interact with the platform: by
viewing other people’s content or by posting your own content.
```

My biggest fear in telling people to model their Dream 100 is that they’ll
think it means they should “copy” their Dream 100. Again, copying is not
the goal; on the contrary, copying is illegal and unethical. Modeling is
watching what others in your market are doing so you can get ideas on what
_you_ can create. To have success on Instagram or on any platform, you have
to be you. Your brand and your personality are the keys to getting people to
follow and engage with you. The differences you bring into the ecosystem
that you serve is the secret that will create your true fans.

Jenna Kutcher said once, “A brand is the image and personality the
business applies to its offers.” The Attractive Character is the voice of your
company, and what you’re doing on social media is creating the image and
personality that can connect with people and lead them into your funnels
and to your offers.
The first step, then, when setting up Instagram is to quickly communicate
in your bio who you are as the Attractive Character. When people find you
on Instagram, the first thing they’ll do is check out your bio. You only have
150 characters to make your first impression and get them to click on the
“Follow” button. You also get one link that you can use to direct people
back into one of your funnels (converting them from traffic that you’ve
earned into traffic that you own). There are a lot of thoughts and beliefs on
what you can or should write in your bio, but I suggest looking at your
Dream 100’s bios, seeing what’s working, choosing what you like, and
modeling them to create your own unique bio.

**Instagram Profile Strategy (Your Gallery)**

Your Instagram profile is the core foundation of your Instagram strategy.
I’ll focus on this first section of the platform because it is the key to
increasing your followers and will fuel your Instagram Stories with their
powerful swipe-ups, Instagram Lives, IGTV, and more.

**The hook (your pictures):** After someone looks at your bio, the next thing
they’ll see is a grid of all the pictures and videos that you’ve posted. Each
picture is a hook that can potentially grab someone who is scrolling on
Instagram and pull them into your funnels. People are automatically able to


see all the pictures on your profile, and if you post them correctly, they’ll
also be able to see them inside of their own news feed.

When I started using Instagram, I had no clue what types of pictures I
should post. If you scroll back on my profile to the very first pictures, you’ll
probably get a good laugh seeing all the random stuff I posted. As a result, I
had low engagement because I had no idea what I was doing.
Shortly afterward, I heard Jenna Kutcher give a presentation on her “JK5
Method” framework. I started using it a few years ago, and I still use it to
this day because it makes posting to my profile simple and fun. Using the
JK5 Method will help you to create connection beyond just what you’re
selling, and to do that, you will need to post more than just your “work.”

To implement the JK5 Method, you first need to create five main
categories of things you’re passionate about. This will help to give you a
recognizable brand, and as you post images, you’ll simply rotate through
these categories so your followers get a good understanding of who you are
beyond what you sell.
For Jenna, her five categories are marriage, body positivity, photography,
fashion, and travel. If you scroll through her profile, you’ll notice that she
cycles through these categories. As I was creating my categories, I thought
about the things most important to me that I wanted to share with the world.
The categories I came up with for my brand were _family_ , _funnels_ , _faith_ ,
_entrepreneurship_ , and _personal development_.

Jenna explained why the JK5 Method helps to grow your brand and
increase your audience:

```
When you adopt this method, you’ll not only create a versatile, well-
rounded, and connected brand, but you’ll also create an interesting
feed that earns you the ability to sell. No two categories live next to
each other in the grid, giving you extra visual element, but also giving
people a way to find a way to connect with you, even if they currently
aren’t on the market for what you’re selling. Oftentimes someone will
follow you for just ONE of the categories while they get to know you,
like you, and trust you, priming them to become a paying client in the
future.
```

It’s important we talk about the overall vibe of your “grid.”
Essentially, your grid is what users see when they scroll through to see
multiple images all lined up in rows of three. It’s easy to get obsessive
about your overall grid aesthetic but what I love about the JK5 is that it
gives people an overarching view of your brand when they click to see
your full profile. If you truly follow the five-category rotation, viewers
will see more than just what you sell but be able to also see if they can
connect to your account enough to FOLLOW you. When someone
lands on your page, they have about 10 seconds to make a decision on
whether or not they want to follow you, and so we want this overall
grid to create connection right off the bat!


```
Figure 10.2: Because I simply rotate between my JK5 categories when I post, my followers can
clearly see what I care about: family, funnels, faith, entrepreneurship, and personal
development.
```
When you’re posting on your profile, never post in real time; your posts
should be thought out and strategic. (Real time posting is for Instagram
Stories.) To curate photos for your profile, most phones will allow you to
set up albums for your pictures. I suggest creating a new album for each of
the five categories in your JK5. Then look back through your camera roll
and move all the existing pictures you’ve taken in the past into these


albums. Chances are this exercise alone will give you a few months’ worth
of the perfect images that you could start using today.

Moving forward, when you take new pictures with your phone, always
add them into these albums. Each day, as you’re looking for a new picture
to post, go into that album on your phone and quickly grab the perfect
picture. On top of pictures, Instagram also allows you to post videos on
your profile that are under 60 seconds, so as you capture short videos that
fit into your JK5, save them in your albums as well.
Before posting any picture or video, though, I highly recommend using
Jenna’s “ABCDQ Test” to see if it is “on brand” and therefore worthy for
your profile. Here is the test:

```
A esthetic: Does it visually show something that fits the personality of
my brand?
B rand: Is it aligned with my dream client or something they will
engage with?
C onsistent: Is it consistent in terms of color or quality to fit within my
overall feed?
D iversity: Is this something different than my last post? Does it create
recognition beyond what I sell?
Q uality: Is this up to the quality I want my clients/followers to expect?
If this stood alone, would it fit my brand?
```
**The story (captions):** After you run it through the ABCDQ Test and you’re
ready to post the image, you need to think about arguably the most
important question of all: “What am I going to say about this picture?” The
picture is the hook that brings people in and grabs their attention, but the
caption tells your story and tries to engage the reader before you make your
offer or CTA.

_Goal of Post._ Each post you make should have one goal. As I post any
picture and write its caption, the first thing I do is decide if the hook is
meant to inspire, educate, or entertain:

```
Inspire: It compels others to feel inspired and capable of big things.
```

```
Educate: It teaches or educates your followers on a subject.
Entertain: It provides entertainment for your followers.
```
_Type of Caption_. After I decide the goal of the post, I try to figure out the
type of caption to post. According to Jenna, the three most common types
of captions and how to use them in business are:

```
Tell a story:
The posts that do the best on Instagram have one thing in common:
they invite you into the story and make you feel a part of the moment,
as if you’re experiencing it beyond the screen. I often pay attention to
the little things or thoughts that happen in my days and turn those into
short Stories I tell through captions. I’m not talking “once upon a
time”–type stories but relatable life experiences that others can connect
with.
Ask a question:
Having an audience (whether it’s 10 people or 1,000 people) gives
you access to people that can help you create the perfect offer! When
you’re not sure what to post, ask a question. People love to feel heard
and be able to share their opinions. At least once a week I love to ask a
question. Often, it’s as simple as: “What is the best book you’ve read
recently?” or as complex as: “Tell me what you’re struggling with
when it comes to Instagram so I can help you!” Questions can be
directly related to your offer or just another way to connect with your
audience. Plus, questions invite engagement onto your feed!
Make a list:
You can have a lot of fun with captions by sharing a short list! Some
examples include: three things people might not know about you, five
facts about your business, three ways to use your products, or the
seven best books you’ve ever read. Lists are a fun way to deliver a
caption that is easy to read or interesting; they can also further connect
you to your followers in unexpected ways beyond the traditional brand
stories you tell! We love sharing lists of our favorite things or writing
```

```
an “introduction”-type post where we share more about us. After all,
new people find and follow our account each week.
```
_Hashtags._ So what is a hashtag, and why do you need it? If you think of
Instagram as a huge filing cabinet, then the hashtags are the filing folders.
When someone searches a hashtag, Instagram finds all the images that use
that same hashtag and gives you a gallery of only those images. For
example, if I post a picture with the hashtag #potatoguns and someone
searches for that hashtag, the picture I post will show up in the #potatoguns
gallery. If they follow that hashtag (because they _love_ potato guns), any new
picture I post with that hashtag could show up in their news feed!

You can use up to 30 hashtags with each post to help your images, or
hooks, show up in the searches and feeds of your dream customers.
Hashtags are the equivalent of keywords in search engines. Sometimes, you
can put your hashtags in your actual caption (we call these overt hashtags)
where your audience will see them, but typically most of your hashtags will
be posted in the first comment after you post your image (we call these
covert keywords).


```
Figure 10.3: To increase our reach, we place a few overt keywords in our post and the majority
of our covert keywords in the first comment.
```
There are many online research tools that can help you to figure out the
best hashtags for your posts, and I do recommend using them, but the
easiest way to research what hashtags you may want to use is to go back to
your Dream 100. They’re already serving your dream clients, so what
hashtags are they using to get in front of them? Look at their hashtags each
day as you’re doing your research and keep a list of the ones that will work
for you too.

**The offer (your call to action):** The last step in creating your post is your
CTA. Every single post needs a CTA, and it can vary from being a very
small ask to being a big CTA. Examples of small asks include: “Double
tap,” “Hit the ‘like’ button,” “Post an emoji,” or “Comment below.”
Examples of bigger calls to action include: “Share this post,” “Tag 3
friends,” “Click the link in my bio,” or “Sign up for ____.”
Calls to action are important for a lot of reasons. Ultimately, they help
you get people off Instagram and onto your lists, but, maybe even more
importantly, they help the algorithms know if people like what you’re
posting. If your audience comments, likes, and engages with what you post,
the algorithms will assume you’re creating content that people want and
they’ll reward you by giving you more exposure. When people comment,
you should be responding to their comments. This will get them more likely
to comment in the future, and it gives other people extra motivation to
comment as well.

Now, let’s quickly recap the basic process to follow when making posts on
your Instagram profile:

```
Follow the JK5 Method and create five main categories of things
you’re passionate about.
Each day, post two pictures on your profile (rotate through your JK5
categories).
Decide the goal of each post: Inspire, Educate, or Entertain.
```

```
Decide the type of caption to use: Story, Ask a Question, or Make a
List.
Choose the hashtags that will make your post show up for your dream
customer.
Add a CTA to get your audience to engage with you.
```
If you need more examples on how to do this, then look no further than
your Dream 100. If they’re successful, you’ll see this pattern within their
posts, and you can model it for your own posts as well.

**Instagram TV Strategy (Your Produced Video Content)**

Instagram TV was originally created to be a competitor of YouTube. Most
people used Instagram as an app that you scrolled through during your in-
between moments, and they wanted to create something that would keep
you in the app for longer stretches of time.

```
Figure 10.4: IGTV episodes are longer videos that usually answer a question or dive more
deeply into a topic.
```

Part of our consistent publishing plan is to test out hooks and test our
material. As I’m posting pictures and publishing Stories, I’m looking to see
what people respond to. What questions do they keep asking me? What
subjects and topics are interesting? When they see behind the scenes of my
life, what parts do they want to understand more?

After identifying their interests, I’ll create a more produced piece of
content that answers these questions or expounds on certain subjects. These
videos become episodes on Instagram TV. Typically, anything over 60
seconds is made into an IGTV post, and they can be up to 60 minutes long.
In our market, we found that the sweet spot for video length is three to five
minutes, so we’ll spend that time answering a question or diving more
deeply into a topic. These videos become our IGTV episodes.
The episode will show up to your fans and followers just like a normal
picture or video that you post on your profile would. After people watch the
first 60 seconds, Instagram will ask if they want to continue watching the
rest of the video inside IGTV, making it vital that the first 60 seconds hook
them into watching the full video or you’ll lose people before they see your
full message. Watch the IGTV’s from your Dream 100 and see what types
of videos they are creating and how they hook people and pull them into
their content.

**Instagram Stories Strategy (Your Reality Show)**

When Snapchat first came out, they became famous for their core feature:
letting you create short, 10-second videos that disappeared after 24 hours. I
spent over a year growing my Snapchat following and had mild success
with my Stories there. The platform was hard to use, it was almost
impossible to grow an audience, and the stats they showed you were almost
useless. However, early trends showed that it was going to be the next big
social network, so we put in the time to try and make it work.

About a year into my Snapchat journey, I embarked on a charity trip to
Kenya with a bunch of big influencers to help build schools. On the second
day, after we had finished working and playing with the kids, we came back
to our camps and checked our phones. That very day, Instagram launched
their new Stories feature. At first, we were skeptical. Honestly, we didn’t


want to make a switch to this new platform after we had spent so much time
building up Snapchat. Reluctantly, though, we decided to test the new
platform. The next morning, we each made the same posts on Instagram
and Snapchat. Then, we watched our stats closely to see which of the two
platforms brought us the most eyeballs and engagement.

Knowing that this was a new feature to Instagram, I had a gut feeling that
Zuckerberg was going to bribe us early adopters with tons of free
engagement so that we’d switch platforms. And that’s exactly what he did.
Despite the fact that my Instagram audience was small (about 30 percent
the size of my Snapchat audience), I got four times more views on each of
my Instagram Stories than I did on Snapchat! As I shared my stats each
night with the other influencers on the trip, we found that all our stats were
about the same. Over the next few weeks, I started posting more and more
on Instagram, and less and less on Snapchat, until, one day, I stopped
logging into Snapchat and eventually deleted the app altogether.
So what exactly are Instagram Stories, and how do they fit into your
Instagram strategy? At the top of the Instagram app, above your feed, you’ll
find a section showing the “Stories” for each of the people that you follow
(your Dream 100).

```
Figure 10.5: Instagram Stories are short, 15-second-long videos that only stay on the platform
for 24 hours and allow your fans and followers to see behind the scenes of your life.
```

If you click on one of their pictures, you’ll see all the short micro videos
that they’ve posted in the past 24 hours. Each video is just 15 seconds long,
and you can post as many each day as you’d like. Because they disappear
after 24 hours, you don’t have to be as methodical about each post, caption,
and CTA as you are with your profile posts. These Stories are more
freestyle.

Personally, I look at my Instagram Stories as my personal reality show
where my fans and followers can see behind the scenes of what I’m doing
each day. I’m literally documenting my journey through the day in short,
15-second mini videos. When I wake up in the morning, I may make a
quick post as I’m walking into the gym, quickly mentioning why I’m
excited or what I’m dreading for the workout. I may make another post
during my workout if I’m doing something new or funny that I think would
be fun to share with my audience. After I leave the gym, I may post a quick
video with one of my kids who just got out of bed and had funny bed head,
or I may have them share their funny or scary dream. Then I get ready for
my day, and I may make a post when I get in my car telling them quickly
about what I’m excited about for that day or what I learned during my
morning study.
Do you see how this works? I’m taking them on my journey during my
day and sharing the highlights, giving them a glimpse of what I’m actually
doing behind the scenes. As I get to the office, I may show them something
I’m working on as I’m doing it. For example, I’ve posted Instagram Stories
almost daily for the past few months showing my followers the process of
me writing this book.

Each day, I know there are tens of thousands of people who watch these
quick videos of me talking about this book and showing them new concepts
or sketches I’m developing as I’m doing it in real time. Can you imagine
how many of them are anxiously waiting for the second this book is done so
they can buy their copy? By letting them participate in the process, they’re
more invested in what I’ve actually been doing. They’re more likely to buy
what I am creating when it’s ready. Instagram Stories are the most powerful
way I’ve ever seen to have your audience build a relationship with you as
the Attractive Character.


Another great way to use Instagram Stories is to promote things you’re
working on in a cool way. I can show people my product or behind the
scenes of how I fulfill my service, and then I can give people a CTA to go
and buy one. Each day, I usually try to make at least one pitch for
something I’m excited for. Instagram stories are my home where I’m able to
push people into my funnels and actually sell to them.

When you first get your Instagram account, it isn’t as easy to promote
products; usually you have to tell your followers to click on the link in your
bio to get taken to your funnel. After your account grows to 10,000
followers, though, you can unlock a really cool feature called “swipe up.” If
you’ve been following others on Instagram, you’ve undoubtedly seen
people do this before. They’ll make a pitch for something and tell you to
swipe up to get access to it. When they swipe up on the screen, they will be
redirected to any link you want.
Every day, I try to make 10–30 posts on Instagram Stories throughout the
day documenting my journey. I’ll typically make one that directs people to
my profile to comment on whatever picture I posted that day. I’ll also make
one with a swipe-up CTA such as getting them to visit a funnel, listen to a
new podcast episode, watch a video on YouTube, or engage with me in a
way outside of the Instagram platform.

**Story Highlights:** These show up under your bio and above your grid. The
way you use Highlights ties back to the JK5 Method, where you pick the
five categories that your brand will be known for and create a “Highlight”
for each one. As you make cool Stories that tie back to one of these five
categories, you can save them as Highlights, and they will automatically
save in that folder. This is a really cool way for people to see the Highlights
over the past months or years tied to your core categories.


```
Figure 10.6: Your Story Highlights allow you to keep your Stories “alive” longer than 24 hours
and are usually organized into categories that are important to you.
```
**“Highlights” mini webinar hack:** We have a little trick that we use to
leverage Highlights to sell a lot of products. About once per month, I pick
one of my products that I want to promote. I block out a full day in my
Stories devoted to promoting that product with a mini webinar. Basically,
throughout the day, I’ll post 15–50 Stories going through a scripted
presentation to sell one of my products. Of course, I’ll usually make a ton
of sales on that day. But because I save it as a Highlight, it will continue to
sell for me every day. Let me walk you through the script for this mini
webinar.


```
Figure 10.7: My mini perfect webinar script still follows my Hook, Story, Offer framework.
```
In the first three Stories, I ask three yes or no questions that I know will
hook my viewers. For those who have read _Expert Secrets_ , these questions
will seem familiar as they sync with the perfect webinar script. Question
one is about the vehicle that I’m trying to put them into, question two
relates to their internal struggle, and question three deals with their external
fears. I ask each question, and then I let my followers answer yes or no.

My next few Stories will relate back to the questions I just asked. I like to
use the framework: Feel, Felt, Found. I might say something like:
I understand how you _feel_...
I _felt_ the same way...
This is what I _found_...
Then I make a few Stories introducing a special offer I created that will
solve the problems people said yes to in the first three Stories.
Over the next 5–20 Stories, I’ll show the proof. I’ll say something like,
“Don’t take my word for it. Check out what others are saying.” Then I’ll
post as many proof images, slides, and videos that I have related to the
offer.

After all my proof, I’ll make a few Stories recapping the offer they’re
getting that day.


Finally, I end with a few Stories talking about any urgency and scarcity
that I have related to this offer.

This is one of my favorite ways to get consistent sales from Instagram.
As people land on your profile and start following you, one of the first
things they look at are your Highlights, so having a few in there that push
your front-end funnels is a powerful way to make the conversion into traffic
that you own.

**Instagram Live Strategy**

The last way to publish on Instagram is Instagram Live. Because Instagram
Live and Facebook Live are so similar in their functionality and use, I won’t
be spending much time on Instagram Live. In fact, I purchased a second
phone with the sole purpose of being able to go live on Instagram at the
same time I went Live on Facebook. That way, I can stream the same
message at the exact same time to both platforms.
One difference between Facebook Live and Instagram Live is that all
Lives on Instagram are stored on the platform for only 24 hours, and then
they’re gone. On Facebook, however, your Lives are stored on the platform
forever, so you can continue to boost and promote your Lives. I’m eagerly
waiting for the day that Facebook and Instagram will just let you stream one
message to both platforms at the same time. Until then, if you don’t have a
second phone, you may just have to borrow a friend’s phone anytime you
go live to get the extra eyeballs to your message on Instagram, or you can
also do your Facebook live from a laptop, and then your Instagram Live
from your phone. If you’re not able to live stream on both platforms, I
suggest you focus all your Live efforts on Facebook as your message can
get more views over the long run. We’ll talk more about the strategy of
Lives in the next chapter with Facebook, but just know that this is the other
area of the app that I treat like my home, i.e., I can use this feature to sell
things to my existing followers.

**Your Publishing Plan**

Each section inside Instagram has different strategies on how you should be
publishing. It’s a lot, I know. I get it. When I first started looking at this


platform, I thought that publishing on it would be another part-time job. So
for me to get this to work, I had to build out a publishing plan that I could
do in less than an hour each day and that was simple and effective enough
for me to stick to it. Using this publishing plan will help to make sure that
you’re using every second on Instagram to its fullest. You can follow my
publishing plan to a T, or you can tweak it to fit your own process.

```
Figure 10.8: Use this publishing plan to see at a glance where you should focus your efforts on
Instagram.
```

###### STEP #4: WORK YOUR WAY IN

As you’re following your publishing plan and posting your content hooks
using the right hashtags, you will start showing up in the feeds of your
dream customers. Having great content for a consistent period of time is the
baseline strategy for growth.

The next level of growth starts when you tap into your Dream 100 and
their followers using the power of Instagram TV. I told you earlier that we
use IGTV to publish produced videos answering questions that our
audience has been asking us. The only problem is that the only people who
see these videos are the ones who follow us or those who happen to see our
hooks in their feed. As we thought about this problem, we wanted a way to
stimulate growth of our channel a lot faster, and that’s when it hit us! We
should do Question-and-Answer Collaborations (or collabs) with our
Dream 100.
Let me explain how it works. A while ago, I got a question from one of
my followers who was trying to figure out why they were struggling with
growing their company. I could have easily made a video response and
posted it, but then I had an idea. There were other people who were actually
more qualified than me to respond to parts of this question. I messaged
Steve J Larsen and told him that someone had asked me a really good
question and that I was going to answer it on video, but I’d love if he’d also
answer it too. He agreed, made the video response, and sent it to me. I also
made a video response, and then I took our two responses and created an
IGTV video, posted it on my profile, and tagged Steve in the video. A huge
number of my followers watched the video, heard Steve’s response, and
went and followed him. I then gave him the same video and asked him to
post it to his IGTV. He posted it, tagged me, and I got a huge stream of new
followers from his account as well. This collab added over a thousand new
followers to my account almost overnight.

We now try to do these collabs with my Dream 100 as often as possible.
Often we’ll do question swapping, where I’ll ask them a question and then
they’ll ask me a question back. We post it on our feeds and both our
channels grow.


You can do similar things when you meet your Dream 100 in real life, at
conferences and events. Take a picture with them, post it to your profile
tagging them, and have them post it to their profile and tag you. The
possibilities are endless. Creative ideas like this are the key to working your
way into the followers of your Dream 100.

###### STEP #5: BUY YOUR WAY IN

To quickly grow your Instagram following, you need to show up on your
Dream 100’s channel. Our favorite way to buy our way in is by getting a
“shout-out.” A shout-out is exactly what it sounds like it is. Basically, one
of your Dream 100 posts on their profile or in their Stories about you. In
their shout-out, they’ll usually mention your name, tell people to follow
you, and tag you. The tag makes a clickable link on Instagram where people
can click on your tag and be taken immediately to your profile, which is
why it’s so important to optimize your profile page.

For example, we found someone on our Dream 100 list (@prbossbabe),
sent her a copy of my _30 Days_ book when it first came out, and paid her to
do a shout-out. She posted a picture of herself with the book, told the story
of the book, and then “shouted me out” by tagging me. This tag directed
people back to my profile to find out more. She made this post on her
profile, and she also published a few Stories with swipe-ups that took
people directly to the book funnel. This post was shown to her 82.8K
followers, received 4,978 likes, and drove hundreds of people to start
following me.


```
Figure 10.9: You can pay influencers to do a “shout-out” and mention you on their profile.
```
You can approach people in your Dream 100 to do paid shout-outs, but
there are also a lot of agencies that specialize in getting shout outs for you.
You can hire them, and they’ll do all the work to find the people, get you
the shout out, and get people to your profile page.

###### STEP #6: FILL YOUR FUNNEL

The last step in this framework is to then use all this exposure and
engagement to convert all of this traffic into traffic that you own. The first
phase is creating your publishing plan and putting out your content hooks to
start to grow your following and build a relationship with them. We use
your Instagram profile and TV to find people and turn them into
subscribers. We can work our way in with collabs and buy shout-outs to
speed up our growth.


As your following is growing, you can then start using your Instagram
stories and get people to swipe up and push your followers into your
funnels. You can also use our “Highlights mini webinar hack” to create mini
webinars on your Highlights that will presell your people on the products or
services you are selling in your funnels!

The last step is to start running prospecting ads (as shown in Secret #9) to
find more of your dream customers and move them into your retargeting
buckets so you can get them into your funnels. Everything you are doing
now is all for the purpose of moving those people into your value ladder
and ascending them up so you can serve them at a much higher level.


##### SECRET #11


### FACEBOOK TRAFFIC SECRETS

Around the same time that Google was trying to figure out how to create
the best search engine ever, other entrepreneurs were trying to solve a
potentially bigger opportunity. Everyone was starting to plug into this world
wide web, so there had to be a way to socially connect all these people
together in a user-friendly interface. There was a race to create the social
network that would stick, and with hundreds of millions of dollars being
thrown at the opportunity, the reward for the winner of this social arms race
was huge.

###### STEP #1: UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY AND THE GOAL

The first attempt to create a website-based social network started back in
1997 with a startup called SixDegrees.com, which was based on the concept
of six degrees of separation.^26 People were able to create an account, add
their friends, and message people within their first three degrees of
separation. They could also see how anyone on the platform connected back
to them. It was one of the first attempts at social media that looked similar
to what we now have today.

The next wave of tools that were created to connect us socially were
online messengers. It started with ICQ in 1996, followed by AOL
Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, MSN Messenger, and finally Skype in

2003.^27

In 2002, we saw the launch of Friendster and the concept of “social
circles,” which mimicked how people were really connected in the real
world. This algorithm eventually beat out SixDegrees.com, which went out
of business just four years after it started. One year later, other companies
showed up based on this same “social circles” concept, such as LinkedIn,
Hi5, and Myspace. Myspace quickly became the most popular social
networking site around. For many people like me, who watched as Myspace
crushed Friendster and the other fledgling social sites, I had assumed that
they would be around forever.


Over the next few years, even more social sites emerged. Flickr became
the first large photo sharing social site in the world, later dethroned by
Pinterest. YouTube became a video sharing service that was later acquired
by Google. Twitter launched with the ability to share micro content, while
Tumblr became a micro blogging site.

In the midst of so many new social startups popping up every day, there
was one that silently launched in 2004 that would soon grow to overshadow
all others. Even with giants like Google trying to dethrone them with the
short-lived launch of their social network, Google Plus, no one has been
able to beat this social media king. Of course, the social network I’m
talking about is Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook.
The story of Facebook’s rise has been documented in movies and books
and talked about so much in the media that I won’t spend much more time
here on its history. Mark’s launch strategy started by allowing only people
with a Harvard email address to get an account. Then he slowly extended
access to other colleges, and eventually he extended access to everyone. At
the time of this writing, Facebook has 2.7 billion users, and 2.1 billion
people use one of Facebook’s core services, including WhatsApp,

Instagram, and Messenger, every day!^28 Yes, over one-quarter of the
world’s population is plugging into the Facebook network daily. It’s the
biggest social party of all time, and unless some type of government
regulation breaks up their monopoly, it will continue to grow.
Facebook has had a lot of scandals around how they handle their users’
privacy and data, which can be super annoying as a user of Facebook, but it
can be a huge blessing as an advertiser on their platform. Facebook tracks
everything you do: What do you like? Which things do you comment on?
Which types of posts do you engage with? All in all, they have up to 52,000
data points on every individual that they accumulated as you were scrolling,

clicking, and commenting.^29 Their goal is to figure out what you like and
show you more of that in your feed. The better your experience is on
Facebook, the more likely you’ll spend more time there; the more time you
spend there, the more ads they can sell to marketers like us.
Because Facebook is tracking so many aspects of your behavior, it gives
us as advertisers the ability to target people based on what they’ll probably
like (their interests). As mentioned in Secret #1, Facebook was the platform


that originally gave us the ability to start using “interruption” marketing,
where we could target those who were interested in what we were selling.
We could interrupt them with a great hook, tell them a story, and then make
them an irresistible offer.

Over time, the algorithm that judges which posts or videos get the most
exposure on Facebook’s platform continues to change. Five years ago, it
was all about making a video that was sharable. If you knew how to get
shares, your videos could get millions and millions of views overnight. As
soon as everyone collectively learned the algorithm, then agencies started to
pop up everywhere, guaranteeing to make you a video that would go viral,
because they knew the algorithm and it worked.
Then Facebook went public, and they needed to raise more money, so
Zuckerberg “snapped his fingers” and changed the algorithm. The new
algorithm no longer rewarded people for having amazing, shareable
content. That didn’t make them money, which was necessary for stock
prices to go up. He needed to change the algorithm so that Facebook could
show higher returns for the investors. Overnight, the majority of “free viral
videos” died, replaced with a new algorithm that required you to buy ads to
boost and promote your videos. With these changes, it required you to buy
views to your video. If those people who saw your paid video liked it, and a
certain percentage of them shared it, then Facebook would reward you with
free viewers. When this would happen, for every paid eyeball you got on
your video, you would get two to three views for free. We used to call these
videos “forced viral” videos, and they became the new standard for each
video we created.

Around this time, there was a land grab for each platform to be number
one with live video. Twitter bought Periscope, and it started to become the
number-one place to stream live videos. I remember those days, because I
was on Periscope streaming live almost daily, that is, until Facebook
launched Facebook Live. To this day, I still like Periscope’s app better;
personally, I think that their streaming service, and pretty much everything
else about it, is way better than Facebook Live, but Facebook wanted to
become _the_ platform for live video streaming, so they changed their
algorithm. After the change, when you would go live on Facebook, you
could get hundreds or thousands of people to show up for free in just


seconds. They rewarded us for going live to force us all to switch to them;
then after they won and beat out all the competitors, they took away much
of the organic reach and made us pay to get more viewers to our videos.

```
Figure 11.1: When a new platform is released, they reward people for using it by giving
everyone free exposure. Over time, your free exposure lessens and you have to buy ads in order
to get as much exposure as you did for free before.
```
Facebook is a growing platform, and although I’m taking a snapshot of
how it works today, it will continue to evolve. The good news is that even
though Facebook’s features, tactics, and user interface change often, your
overarching strategy does not. Whenever I’m diving into a new platform, I
always begin by asking myself these three questions:

What is the goal of the platform?
What is the strategy that I can use to help the platform with its goal?
What are the tactics that the platform is rewarding people for right
now?
For example, the _goal_ of Facebook is to have its users create content that
will keep people on their platform for as long as possible so they can show
them ads. Our _strategy_ is to figure out what content Facebook is rewarding
people for right now and how Facebook wants that content to be promoted
(both free and paid), and then for us to try to create the type of content they


want. The _tactics_ are what that content looks like. This changes daily, but
we can get a glimpse of what is working right now by watching our Dream
100, seeing the things showing up consistently in our news feed that are
getting the best engagement, and then modeling these things.

###### STEP #2: FIND YOUR DREAM 100 ON THIS PLATFORM

Surprise, surprise. The first step when you start using Facebook is to
identify your Dream 100 that have already mastered this platform and
congregated your dream customers. If you haven’t yet, be sure to clean up
your Facebook feed by unfollowing everything that isn’t tied to your Dream
100 and your dream customers. This will keep the noise down as you step
into this next phase.

Your Dream 100 are the people, experts, influencers, and brands in your
market that have already congregated your dream customers. It is also the
owners of the groups in your market. Each of these people and groups have
their own social party happening, and your goal is to first identify the
party’s attendees (e.g., people, brands, interests, and groups) and then to
leverage Facebook to get these people into your funnels.
There will likely be a few big names in your market that you’re already
familiar with, which is where I would start. Find their Fan Pages and “like”
and “follow” those pages. Then find their personal pages and try to friend
request them and follow their personal profiles too. Typically, after you do
that, Facebook will find other people who have similar followings that you
could follow. Go down that rabbit hole and start following every influencer
you can find in your market that has a following. The same is true with
groups. You can search for groups in your market and join them, and as you
do, more groups will be “suggested” to you by Facebook. Join the ones that
your dream customers are already congregating in.

Finding your Dream 100 is not a one-time activity but instead an “every
time” activity where every time you’re on Facebook, you should look for
these new congregations or people and plug into them as they start showing
up in your feed. As you do this, your Facebook feed will become the best
market research tool in the world. You’ll see every important conversation
that your dream customers are engaging in. You’ll see every ad being run to


your customers. You’ll see the messages they’re exposed to, the people they
connect with, the pains they have, the questions they want answers to, and
the opportunities you can create to better serve them. This is what your
Facebook feed is for: mastering your market.

My goal when following all influencers in my market is to plug into an
ecosystem of at least 1 million people. For example, if I’m able to find 20
people to follow, and each of them has a following of 30,000 people, then
I’m plugged into about 600,000 people. That means I need to keep finding
influencers or brands or groups until that whole universe of people is at
least 1 million people. For some of you, especially local-based companies,
it may be hard to find 1 million people, so you can set a smaller goal; for
others who have larger target markets, 1 million may seem too small. Set
your goals to match your market size and then follow the influencers and
brands you need to get to your magic number.

###### STEP #3: IDENTIFY THE PUBLISHING STRATEGY AND CREATE

###### YOUR PUBLISHING PLAN

It’s important to remember that Facebook is the biggest social party in the
world. It’s happening 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and the majority of
your dream customers are already there. You don’t have to create traffic;
you have to find the existing streams of traffic and figure out how to funnel
those people into your world. While there are a lot of things that you can do
inside of Facebook (and they’ll continue to add more things), there are four
areas of the platform that you must master.

```
Your personal profile (your home)— As you are “working your way
in” (e.g., going out and commenting on people’s posts, joining groups
and posting content and more), the friends, fans, and followers of your
Dream 100—as well as the members of those groups—will see your
profile picture, click on your face and be taken from the social party to
your personal profile. This is your home, and this is where you’ll be
able to direct people into your funnels.
Your Fan Page (your show)— I know, Facebook no longer calls this a
“Fan Page,” they call it a “Page,” but I’m old school and still call it a
```

```
Fan Page because it helps me to identify its goal in my marketing plan.
This is where you are “buying your way in.” After you post content on
your Fan Page, you will be paying (“buying your way in”) to boost it
to the followers of your Dream 100.
Groups (your hangout)— This is where you throw your own social
networking party and build relationships with your tribe.
Messenger (your distribution channel)— This is one of the most
powerful distribution channels that you have to get your message
quickly to your most hyperactive followers.
```
I will now dig deep into the publishing strategies of each of these four
areas of the Facebook platform.

**Your Personal Profile Strategy (Your Home)**

Before we start our social networking, we need to make sure that our home,
or personal profile, is ready when people start coming over. Most of your
interaction online will be happening through your personal profile. As you
comment, share, help, and engage with other people, they’ll see how much
value you’re providing and click to see your profile page. If you structure
your profile page correctly, it will grab your dream customers who are
looking for more information about you and turn them into traffic that you
own. Facebook allows people to “follow” your personal profile, but you
have to turn it on in the settings. Make sure you give people that ability,
because even though you can only have 5,000 “friends,” you can have an
unlimited number of followers.


```
Figure 11.2: If your profile page is set up correctly, it can convert people who want to know
more about you into people on your lists.
```
**Getting your profile set up correctly:** There are three things that you can
customize on your personal profile. You have to be careful because
Facebook doesn’t want your personal page to be for business, so none of
these elements are meant to be a hard pitch for anything; instead it serves as
a landing page where people can get to know you better and decide to be a
friend or follower who will see your status updates in the future.

```
Your cover photo: You can design and upload a cover photo that
represents you and your brand. It’s an image that your visitors will be
able to see and know that they’re in the right place. Do not put a CTA
on your cover photo, as this screams that you are trying to sell
something on your personal page.
Intro section (your business card): In the intro section of your
profile, you’re able to tell a little bit about yourself.
Featured Image: You can feature an image from a post you’ve made
here. I have a picture of my three books. When someone clicks on that
image, they are taken to a post where I have links to the three books in
the description. This is the first way that I start filling my funnels from
my personal profile.
```

**What’s on your mind? (conversations at your “home”):** As you are
“working your way in” and people are coming back to your “home” or
profile page, they will see the recent conversations that you’ve started, and
if a hook grabs them, it will pull them into your conversations and into your
funnels. These conversation starters will also show up in the feeds of your
friends and the people who follow you. Each post is an opportunity to hook
someone, tell them a story, and get them to take some action.

If you’ve read the earlier chapter on Instagram, you will notice that the
strategy here is very similar to how we post on our Instagram profile. If you
remember Jenna’s JK5 Method, we each picked five categories that
represent our brand. My categories are family, funnels, faith,
entrepreneurship, and personal development. Just like I rotate through these
five categories as I’m posting images to my Instagram profile, I rotate
through these same categories as I’m posting “what’s on my mind.” If all
the personal posts are about business, oftentimes Facebook will shut you
down for operating a personal page like a business page, so by diversifying
what I post over those five categories, I am at less risk, and it also builds a
connection with my followers outside of just my “work.”
The big difference between my Instagram profile and my Facebook
personal profile is that on Facebook, this is my home, so I’m okay with
starting conversations with a goal to direct people into a funnel. Typically,
Facebook will penalize personal posts (not show them to many people) that
have a link in the status update, so I will typically make the post telling the
story and then have the link to the CTA in the comments section. Here is an
example of a post I made recently that follows this process:


```
Figure 11.3: To encourage Facebook to show my post to more people, I’ll often post my CTA
link in the first comment instead of in my actual post.
```
I try to make at least one update to my personal page each day. These
updates are more than just an image and a caption; typically they are a
longer form story, structured almost like a Daily Seinfeld email where I
have a hook, tell a story, and make an offer.

Each day, as I’m trying to figure out what to post, I ask myself, _What’s
the hook that will make people want to hear this story?_ The hook could be a
quick headline or a picture, but it should be something that will stop people
scrolling through their newsfeed. After I place the hook, I tell the story, give
the rant, or share the big “aha” that’s been on my mind that day. Then after I
tell the story, I figure out how that ties back into where I want to send
someone. What’s the offer I want to make to them? Sometimes the offer is
as simple as wanting them to like my post, leave a comment, or tell me their
story. Other times, the offer is for them to listen to a podcast episode or read
a blog post. Still other times, I ask for the _big_ offer, and I direct them to one
of my front-end funnels.
My secret for figuring out what to post each day comes back to the JK5. I
open my phone and look at the picture albums I set up to categorize all of
my images. I look through the album for the category that I’m posting about
that day, find an image that will work as a hook, tell the story behind the
image, and then make my offer. You can also go Live on your personal


profile and tell your story through video, but I personally like to save my
Live videos for my Fan Page (so I can pay to boost them) or for my group
where I’m using it as a way to “hang out” with my tribe.

As people come to your page from different sources, they’ll first see your
billboard (cover photo) and find out what you’re all about, then they’ll see
your business card (the intro section) and finally they’ll see your
conversation starters (your posts). If one of these hooks grabs them, you’ve
started a conversation on your wall with your dream customers. As people
comment on your posts, be sure to spend some time replying to their
comments. This one small act speaks volumes, and it helps to build
relationships with your dream customers.

**Your Fan Page Strategy (Buying Your Way In)**

When Facebook first launched, it was structured so that each profile could
only have 5,000 friends, and that limit remains to this day. Having this limit
helped keep the integrity of Facebook as it was growing by keeping
people’s news feeds filled with the things and people they actually cared
about, which helped cause a deeper addiction to the platform. The problem
was that it made it hard for businesses and brands to really do business
online, because their pool of potential customers was just 5,000 people.
Other social networks didn’t have this limitation, which caused people to
mass create accounts to build up fake followings. Later, Facebook did
create a way where people could follow your personal profile without being
an actual “friend,” which has made the strategy I shared earlier so much
more powerful.
A few years later, on November 6, 2007, Facebook launched “Pages”
(which I’ll refer to through this book as “Fan Pages”), where a person or a

brand could have followers or fans on that page.^30 There was no limit to the
number of fans that someone could have. Adding Pages gave Facebook the
ability to see the things people were interested in more closely, and this
paved the way for Facebook’s advertising platform that we came to love so
much.
The first question I get from almost everyone I know who starts trying to
drive traffic from Facebook is, “Do I need a personal page and a Fan Page,


or can I use just one?” My answer always is that you need both. Each has a
different role, and both are essential. Your personal profile is how you get
free, earned traffic (working your way in), while your Fan Page is how you
get the chance to buy traffic (buying your way in).

You should view your Fan Page more like your website. Julie Stoian,
who has served as the ClickFunnels VP of Marketing, said:

```
Think of your Facebook page as the Facebook version of your
website. I treat this page very carefully. I only put the most curated and
the best content on this page. It is the first impression for anyone who
sees your paid ads. They will click on the profile of the brand running
the ad, and your Fan Page is what they will see. I treat this page almost
like my YouTube profile, where, when people come to it, they will see
the brand, but then they will hopefully start engaging with all of the
videos and images and things that have been posted there. My test for
if something should be on my Page is this: Is this content good enough
that I will spend at least $10–$20 to boost it? If you’re not willing to
pay for ads to that content, then do not post it on your Fan Page.
```
Now, before I scare you away from posting anything on your Fan Page, I
want to talk about the types of things that we do post there. The key is to
post things that you believe will get high engagement from your fans. If
your engagement is low, it will make all your posts across your Page go
down, but if a piece of content you post has high engagement, then
everything will go up. Often, I’ll use my personal profile or my Instagram
feed to start testing material and images and find the hooks and stories that
people resonate with, and then I’ll turn those things into more produced
content on my Fan Page that I can boost with money.
There are four things that we post on our Facebook Fan Pages. Let me
walk you through each one and the strategy behind how we use them.


```
Figure 11.4 We have a specific strategy for each area of the platform, including our Facebook
Fan Page.
```
**Produced value videos:** These are videos that have a good hook and story
but _no offer._ The direct response marketer in me hates these videos, but the
branding marketers loves them. For some reason, when you have a CTA,
people will rarely share your videos. By not having a CTA, if people love
the videos, they’ll like, comment, and share, and that’s how you get paid for
this content. This increased engagement will boost everything else you do
on your Fan Page. In Gary Vaynerchuk’s book _Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook,_^31
he talks about the strategy of giving (jabbing) good content and building a
relationship before you do the big ask (right hook). Because of that, we will
try to do three to four content videos for everyone that is pushing a hard
CTA.

**Live value videos:** These videos are almost the same as our “produced
value videos” except that they aren’t pre-produced. We go Live on the
platform, and in real time we deliver the message. Facebook currently
favors Live videos over published videos, so we do these often. There are
also some powerful software tools that will let you take a produced video
and stream it through their services so it’s published as if it’s live. I’ll link
to some of these services in the resources section here: TrafficSecrets.com/r
esources.


**Live perfect webinars:** These are the “right hooks” that will become your
big paydays. If you’ve been providing value, now you have the opportunity
to actually sell to your audience. In _Expert Secrets_ , I shared my “Perfect
Webinar” script, and I showed you Kaelin Poulin’s “Perfect Webinar Hack,”
where Kaelin started using this script on her Facebook Lives to direct
people into her front-end funnels. Jaime Cross from MIG Soap also
modified this script into the “Five-Minute Perfect Webinar” that is a
powerful and simple script to use on your Facebook Lives to drive people
into your front-end funnels. You can print out these scripts for your own use
by going to TrafficSecrets.com/resources.

**Curated content from your other platforms (reruns):** I’ll take content
that I’m posting on my other social networks that are getting high
engagement and post it on my Fan Page. I don’t link out to that other
content; I’ll actually repost it here natively. For instance, with my YouTube
videos, I’ll upload them to YouTube, but I’ll also upload them separately to
Facebook. I look at this reposted content similarly to how we view reruns
on TV. The videos are there, and we may watch and engage with them, but
we’re eagerly waiting for the new episode of our favorite show that is
coming out soon.

After we post any of this content, we always do exactly what Julie
suggested: I spend $10–$20 boosting that content. Sometimes the goal is to
get engagement on the pitch-free content (with a goal to increase what
happens when I post my Live perfect webinars). When there is a Live that
pushes to a funnel, if I at least break even on my ad spend, I’ll keep running
the ads until I start losing money. Sometimes the Facebook Live video ad
will be profitable, and we may keep running ads to it for months!

**Your Groups Strategy (Your Hangout)**

When I got started online, before there was Facebook, there were forums. I
was a member of a dozen or so marketing forums that I would frequent
each day to ask questions, get answers, and grow my personal brand. The
owners of those forums were powerful. They had a huge congregation of
people hanging out at the party that was happening at their house every day.


The conversations that happened inside of these forums were the things that
shaped our industry. I realized that if I wanted to have control over the
direction of our market, I needed to be the one who ran the parties where
everyone hung out. After all, the person throwing the party generally has
the most influence in the group.

I decided right then that I needed to start my own forum. Back then, I had
to get software to run a forum, servers to host the site, and about a dozen
other things. It took me a few months, but I finally ended up launching a
forum that grew pretty large. About that time is when Facebook launched
their “groups.” I was a little hesitant to create a new group, but because
traffic on my old forum was drying up as people were shifting their habits
to Facebook, we decided to give it a try.
We created the first “official” ClickFunnels group and invited our new
customers into it. At first, we used it as a way to help take some of the
responsibility of support off our shoulders and get the community to help
serve each other. But then it started to grow. We told new members to come
join our community to meet other funnel hackers and share their ideas, and
then Facebook started to promote the group as well. Soon we had thousands
of people a week joining without us spending a penny on advertising. As of
the writing of this book, we have over 223,000 people in that group and
Facebook adds over 1,200 new members per week! Our members currently
average a total of over 317 posts a day (that’s one every five minutes
around the clock). There are over 9,414 comments and reactions per day
(that’s one every nine seconds and well over a quarter million each month).
Some of our top posts can get 30,000–50,000 impressions each, which is all
free organic traffic.

Facebook wants people to build groups, and as of this writing, they are
rewarding people for doing it. I saw a commercial on TV the other day from
Facebook promoting groups! Yes, they are actually buying commercials on
TV to promote them. Can you see the irony there? One of the biggest
advertising platforms in the world is trying to find more ways to get people
building groups on their platform. For some reason, they want people
building groups to increase the experience for their users, so this is where
we’re spending a lot of our time now.


Your group is your own personal party. It’s a place on social media for
your people to gather, hang out, and talk. I’m a big believer that most
companies should have a group where the members of their community can
network. It will become a huge source of traffic for you, help turn your
warm audience into raving fans, and give you the ability to be an influence
on the most important group in your marketplace.

I try to do a weekly “hangout” in my group where I can talk to our tribe
and build a personal relationship with them. As of today, we have over
1,000 people per month that join ClickFunnels directly from this group, so
the more I can jump in and build relationships with them, the better. I don’t
typically structure my hangouts; instead I jump in, tell a story, and take
open questions from people in the group. At the end, I’ll typically make a
CTA for people to go get their free ClickFunnels trials, and then I’m done.
It’s a really fun part of my week and it can help to endear your tribe back to
you.

**Your Messenger Strategy (Your Distribution Channel)**

Facebook Messenger started as a simple way for us to chat with our friends
who were also on Facebook, but in 2016, Facebook opened their “bot”
platform.^32 Over the past few years, these bots made it possible for
marketers like us to use Messenger in a similar way to email
autoresponders. It gave publishers the ability to message subscribers
directly with news and other information, and it also gave them the ability
to set up basic chats between their subscriber and the Messenger app.
Essentially, you can pre-write questions and answers to help solve your
subscribers’ problems or you can direct them somewhere else.

If you’d like to build lists, set up sequences, do broadcasts, and more, go
to TrafficSecrets.com/resources to see an up-to-date list of some amazing
companies that have built awesome Messenger integrations. I won’t
mention any specific ones in the book because companies come and go, but
I’ll update the list online so it always has the best Messenger integrations to
work with.
Messenger has rules to protect it from being used as a platform where
people are sending out spam, and because of that, if you’re too aggressive,


they can and will shut you down. So it’s essential to use it in a way that
enhances users’ experience instead of in a way that annoys them. We rarely,
if ever, send out more than one message per week. Most of our messages try
to create engagement before a link is sent. A great way to do this is to send
out quizzes or interactive conversations, basically anything that will keep
engagement high and complaints low. If you do that, you’ll be able to use
Messenger without any issues.

**Growing your Messenger list:** There are three core ways that you can
grow your Messenger list.

First, when people come to your Fan Page, you can have Messenger pop
up to start a conversation that will add them to your Messenger lists.

```
Figure 11.5 To grow your Messenger list, you can have Facebook automatically pop up a
Messenger window in the lower right-hand corner. When they chat with you, they’re
automatically subscribed to your Messenger list.
```
Second, on your landing pages, you can have people select a box that will
add them to your Messenger lists. Most of the Messenger chat-bot growth
tools make it easy to add this to your landing pages.


```
Figure 11.6: You can also grow your Messenger list by adding a Messenger checkbox to your
opt-in forms. When they check the box, they’ll be automatically subscribed to your Messenger
list.
```
The third (and my favorite) way is to create a simple lead magnet and
leverage your Fan Page to grow your Messenger list. Some of the
Messenger growth tools make it easy to add people to your lists when they
do a certain action. For instance, when people click a button on your post or
comment with a certain keyword, you can add them directly to a specific
Messenger list and it will send them a lead magnet right away.
Alison Prince showed me my new favorite model for how to do this. She
is a member of my Inner Circle (my high-end coaching program), and she
has a company teaching people how to start a business online selling e-
commerce products. She will do a Facebook Live teaching “10 tips to.. .”
or “seven tools that.. .”–type videos where she shares a list of cool things


with people. Then she designs a really nice PDF with the things that she
talks about on her Live. Throughout the Live, she’ll show a printed copy of
the lead magnet and tell people if they want a free copy, they just need to
comment using a certain keyword and she’ll send it to them through
Messenger. Every time she goes live, she’s adding hundreds of new people
to her lists.

**Publishing to your Messenger lists:** Because my Messenger list is such a
valuable asset, and because I don’t own it (Facebook owns it and can shut it
off at any time), I treat it very carefully. When someone first joins your list,
you want to get them to interact with your Messenger bot because this helps
to increase the engagement. Ultimately, this increases your ability to
continue to send that person more messages in the future.

About once per week, we try to send out some type of conversation.
Notice that I said “conversation” and not message. We don’t just broadcast
out a message for someone to go and visit a funnel. Instead, we’ll ask them
a question like, “Hey, are you still looking for ways to generate more leads
online?” If they respond back with a yes, then I might say something like,
“Cool. I have some new training that I think you’re gonna LOVE, but I
wanted to see if you’d rather have it as an audio file, a video, or a
transcript.” After three buttons pop up with these options, they can click
one of the choices, which will take them to the next step in the bot’s
conversation.


```
Figure 11.7: With Messenger, I can set up automatic conversations to reach my followers inside
Facebook.
```
I personally like to use bots to guide people toward content on
Facebook’s platform (like a Facebook Live on my Fan Page) and have the
actual selling happen off Messenger. That gives me an arm’s distance from
Messenger and selling anything directly through it. It also helps to boost my
Facebook Live, which Facebook loves, and gives my subscribers value
before I make them the offer.


**Your Publishing Plan**

We’ve covered a lot of things about publishing on Facebook. We talked
about the core ways you publish inside Facebook with special focus on:

```
Your personal page
Your Fan Page
Your groups
Your Messenger lists
```
Each of these sections inside of the platform has a different strategy for
how you publish. To make sure you hit each part of Facebook effectively to
find and serve your dream customers, I have created an at-a-glance
publishing plan so you can quickly see what content you should publish in
each area, with your daily and weekly activities broken down into a simple,
step-by-step process.


```
Figure 11.8: Use this publishing plan to see at a glance where you should focus your efforts on
Facebook.
```
###### STEP #4: WORK YOUR WAY IN

If you’ve done steps one through three and your personal profile is set up,
then your house is now in order and you’re ready to start being social and
actually network. We do this by finding the groups in our marketplace that
have already congregated our dream customers. First, I want you to focus
on finding and joining the right groups. When you click on the group tab,
Facebook will suggest groups that it thinks you’ll like based on the
influencers and brands that you’re already following. You’ll also be able to
see the groups’ names and how many members are in each group.


Similar to the strategy used for influencers and brands, your goal with
groups is to get access to at least 1 million people through them. I look at
the suggested groups, join the ones that have bigger member counts, and
continue searching for more. After this initial exercise, you’ll see new
groups marketed to you through your Facebook feed, so I recommend
continuing to join the groups that have already gathered your dream
customers.

For example, if I’m a photographer and I type “photography” into the
group search in Facebook, it will pull up dozens of groups I can join. In this
case, there are over 507,000 people at four parties talking about
photography. These are the parties that I’ll be going to and networking at.
Keep going to parties (i.e., joining groups) until your reach in these groups
is over 1,000,000 people.


```
Figure 11.9: Join as many groups in your niche as you can until you’re able to reach over
1,000,000 people.
```
Now, some people think that networking means going into these groups,
spamming out links to your front-end funnels, and hoping that people will
click on them and join your lists. This is not what I’m talking about. In most
groups, this will get you kicked out almost immediately and will ruin your
reputation in that market. Instead, every day I go into each of those groups
and try to see what questions people are asking that I know the answer to.


As soon as I can think of something awesome that I can share, I write a
value-filled post and post it in the group. No pitch... no ask... just value.

That is the secret to good networking. You are coming to serve, and if
you do it consistently, people will see you, and they will follow you back to
your home. But the secret is giving without withholding. This is the
beginning of your value ladder, and the more value you give up front, the
more people will want you.
After I make my post, I scroll through the other questions and try to
comment or reply to at least three questions per group, and that’s it. I spend
30 minutes total each day participating in these groups, providing value,
and answering questions, and then I’m done. Consistency is the key. Keep
providing value, and do not sell anything. Remember, your goal is to
become the cool kid at the party, and if you provide value, everyone will
want to come back to your house to hang out.

This strategy takes a little time, but if you are consistent and people see
you showing up consistently, they will want to find out more. They’ll click
on your profile, and they will follow you. You’ll be pulling people from
these cold and warm groups and turning them into hot traffic that will start
engaging in the conversations that you’re posting on your own personal
profile.

###### STEP #5: BUY YOUR WAY IN

There are a lot of companies who don’t really want to get into the whole
publishing game and want to focus only on paid ads instead. While I think
that’s very shortsighted, I do understand because it allows you to get ads up
and running and to be able to test offers quickly. If you decide to start solely
with paid ads, I would still recommend going back sometime soon and
building the content foundation because doing so will create a more stable
long-term foundation for your business.
As I discussed earlier, when new platforms come out, content creators are
rewarded with free traffic to create adoption on the platform. Soon, though,
the platforms transition to paid ads, and the content creators see less and
less free traffic. Eventually, they have to pay for traffic, as this is where the
platforms will make their money long-term. So even if you’re getting


traction with your content strategy, it’s essential to master paid ads if you
want to be relevant long-term to amplify the content, videos, and ads that
you create.

All the paid ads happen on your Fan Page. This is where you can
boost/pay to get your content shown to the followers of your Dream 100.
Every video you post, every image you publish, and each post you write on
your Fan Page can be promoted through Facebook’s Ads Manager. You can
also make “unpublished posts” that don’t show up on your feed, but that
you can start using to throw out hooks to grab the attention of your dream
customers. Remember from Secret #9 that the more creative you can put
out, the more success you will have. Use all these hooks to grab your dream
customers from your prospecting pools, pull them into your retargeting
buckets, and direct them to your funnels.

###### STEP #6: FILL YOUR FUNNEL

As you know, the last step of the framework is to take all this attention and
use it to fill your funnels. At first, you do it by “working your way in.” As
you go out into Facebook’s groups and start networking and providing
value, you will be pushing people back to your personal profile (your
home). On your personal profile, you will be rotating through the JK5
categories and making posts that can hook people when they show up on
your page, as well as your friends and followers, and direct these people
into your funnels.
To build an even stronger relationship with your friends and followers,
you can invite them to come to your own social networking party (your
group) where they can network with others and be part of your weekly
“hangout” meetings. On your personal profile, they are only able to respond
to posts you make, but here they can start their own conversations and get a
sense of belonging inside your tribe.

After your social networking strategy is up and running, transition your
focus to “buying your way in” with your Fan Page, where you will be
producing and posting content that you feel good enough about spending
$10–$20 to boost it. These will be seen by your existing audiences and help
to build a stronger relationship with them, as well as directing them back


into your funnels, but you will also be targeting the followers of your
Dream 100 and the interests of your dream customers. This means that you
are paying for these videos, posts, and ads to show up in their news feed.

Remember to study Secret #9 to know the best way to target your dream
customers and pull them into your funnels. Your number-one goal is to
transition the traffic that you are earning and buying into traffic that you
own by taking them through one of your front-end funnels.


# SECRET #12

## GOOGLE TRAFFIC SECRETS

The first time someone told me about Google, I was at a public library in
2001 in New Jersey, frustrated at how hard it was to find things online. The
lady sitting next to me leaned over and said, “You should try
[http://www.Google.com.](http://www.Google.com.) It’s new, and every time I search on it, I’m always able
to actually find what I’m looking for.”

I shrugged and decided to give it a try. I slowly typed it in for the first time,
letter by letter, and after the search bar loaded, I typed in the same
keywords I had tried on a dozen other search engines. Within seconds, I
found exactly what I was looking for! I’m assuming that your first
experience was probably similar, and that’s why we all kept going back.

#### STEP #1: UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY AND THE

#### GOAL

It was 1996 at Stanford University when Larry Page and Sergey Brin

started working on their first search engine called BackRub.^33 At the time,
searching on the internet was just starting. Search engines like Excite,
Yahoo!, Ask Jeeves, and more started to pop up. They each had different
ways they indexed pages and showed their results.

Larry and Sergey had the idea that a better way to display search results
was to look at the number of links coming back to a page (called backlinks)
to estimate the value of that page. They theorized that the more backlinks
pointed to a page, the more important the website must be, and therefore,
the higher it would rank in the search engines. They wrote a mathematical
algorithm that was based on that premise and created what are often called
“spiders” to crawl the internet and count the number of backlinks pointing
to every web page they could find, identifying the keyword phrases that are
on the actual web page, and then ranking them for those keywords.


They found out quickly that their hypothesis was correct. This new
algorithm made for a better searching experience for the end user, and it
started to grow fast. The first year they hosted BackRub on Stanford’s
servers, but eventually, when they used up too much bandwidth, they had to
move it. On September 15, 1997, they registered Google.com, and
launched a dynasty based on a simple algorithm.

Google’s algorithm made the so-called “cream of the World Wide Web”
automatically rise to the top of the search results. In turn, the companies
whose sites were indexed at the top of the search engines for certain
keywords got flooded with so much traffic, so many visitors, and so many
leads that many of them couldn’t keep up with the business. Being ranked
on the first page in Google for a major keyword could bring you hundreds
of thousands (and in some cases millions) of dollars overnight! With that
much money on the line for each ranked keyword, almost everyone who
noticed what was happening wanted to be at the top, no matter the cost.

That’s the funny thing about algorithms: they don’t care who you are. They
don’t care who has the best product, the best customer support, or who will
treat the customers the best. All they know is that if a page meets their
certain criteria, they rank it higher than a page that doesn’t meet their
criteria. It’s that simple. When you understand that, then the question
quickly becomes, “What exactly is the algorithm looking for, and how do I
tweak what I’m doing to beat the algorithm so I can be ranked at the top?”

Google’s original algorithm was primarily based on backlinks. If you had
100 links on other people’s websites all pointing to your page and your
competitor had 101 links, your competitor would outrank you. As soon as
people hacked the algorithm and figured out what made them win, they
would do whatever they needed to rank them at the top.

```
image
```
**Figure 12.1: Google’s original algorithm ranked a website at the top if
it had the most backlinks for a certain search keyword.**

I first discovered this when I was launching one of my first funnels ever. It
was for my product teaching people how to make potato guns. I did some


very basic keyword research and found that, at the time, there were about
18,000 people per month searching for the keyword phrase “potato gun.” I
was shocked that there were that many searches and no one was selling a
product showing people how to make potato guns! So I made a DVD, set
up my funnel, and tried to get traffic.

The first thing I did was type “potato gun” into Google, and I looked at the
sites that were ranking on the first page. I had heard people say that the
secret to being a good real estate investor was “location, location, location.”
I remember thinking that these 10 spots on page number one were the most
prime real estate in the world for someone selling potato gun plans. Being
ranked on that first page was the big secret!

I had to figure out how to get on that page, and the first step was figuring
out the algorithm that decided which pages deserved to be at the top.
Google was still in its infancy then, and as I started researching how to
outrank my competitors, I learned that the only thing that mattered was
backlinks. There were a few rudimentary tools that would show you how
many links a page had, and within minutes, I knew exactly how many links
I needed to be on the first page and how many links I needed to be in the
top spot.

After that, it was on like Donkey Kong. I started doing everything in my
power to get links. I would buy links from people. I found sites that would
let me post links in their directories. I would post in forums and link back
to my page. I would basically drop links on any and every page that would
let me, including “Free for All,” or FFA, pages (later nicknamed “link
farms”), where you could submit as many links as you wanted. Within
days, I saw my site move from the 100th page in Google to the 50th, to the
20th, and finally all the way to the second page! I was almost there! I was
so close I could taste it. Within days, I would have my new potato gun
storefront property listed on the most ideal real estate in the world: page
one for my dream keyword.

And then it happened. It was my first of many experiences with a Google
slap. Overnight, my page was gone, dropped from the search engines
forever. I didn’t know why. I didn’t understand where it went, but as I went
looking for answers, I saw that it wasn’t just me.


In the big scheme of things, my potato gun keywords were tiny. While
18,000 people might seem like a lot when you’re printing and shipping
potato gun DVDs from your basement, it was tiny in relation to other
keywords. Some keywords get hundreds of thousands or millions of
visitors a month. Imagine being on page number one for “hotels” or “cars.”
These keywords can and do make hundreds of millions of dollars for those
who can hold their spot at the top. But even the phrase “emergency
plumber Boise Idaho” will grow a local company faster than anything else
one could ever dream of.

So what was the Google slap? Well, each slap is different and is issued for
different reasons, but the main reason always comes down to the battle
between Google and the marketers. Google wants to show its visitors the
best web page for every search. Marketers like us want our web page to be
shown at the top. The battle between us and each platform is why the
algorithms have to constantly change and evolve. That’s why almost every
book that has ever been written on getting online traffic is obsolete within
months.

These slaps happen with Google, and they also occur with Facebook,
Instagram, and YouTube. As soon as the platforms figure out the perfect
algorithm that shows the best results, us marketers all start using our
creative minds to figure out how to hack the algorithm so we can be in the
number one spot or to make our videos go viral or get our posts, pictures,
and images to get the most likes, shares, and views. With each keyword,
image, or viral video potentially being worth millions of dollars, these
platforms have created a scenario where the smartest people in the world
are all focused on reverse engineering the algorithm for themselves, to get
and keep their companies at the top.

That is why, in this book, I’m never going to tell you how to hack an exact
algorithm. We never really know exactly what it is, even though we can get
close by modeling what is currently having success. And it changes
constantly. So instead of showing you how to hack an exact algorithm, I’ll
show you the history of each algorithm, as well as the changes that have
taken place over time. After all, understanding the history and the changes
make it easier to see the future and where things are going. I’ll show you


how to figure out what the algorithms are right now on each platform so
you can play the game that is working today, in real time. The real secret to
traffic isn’t knowing exactly what the algorithm is before you get on each
platform; the real secret is being able to look at each platform and quickly
figure out what the algorithm is now.

Let me quickly take you through a history of each Google slap so you can
understand the evolution of the algorithm and where it is today.

**The Four Phases of Google**

**Phase #1—Popularity through backlinks:** As you’ve just seen, the big
breakthrough that made Google the best search engine in the world was that
they ranked your web pages based on how many other pages were talking
about you and linking back to you. Each link that someone else posted on a
page that linked back to your website counted as a “vote” and pushed your
page up through Google’s rankings.

The game was fun. You would pick a keyword you wanted, find out how
many backlinks the person who was ranked number one had, and then you
only needed to get more backlinks than they had. For example, if the
number-one spot had 100 backlinks, you needed at least 101 backlinks to
replace them.

The problem is that it created a game that was easy to win if you were okay
with spamming the search engines. People would hire huge teams of
workers overseas to post their links on every website they could find.
Eventually, software was also built that would allow you to post hundreds
of links with the simple click of a few buttons. What started out as the
perfect ranking algorithm quickly became a cesspool with the most
spammed pages rising to the top. This didn’t give Google’s users a good
customer experience, so they had to make changes.

**Phase #2—Page rank and on-page optimization:** To clean up this mess,
Google started to look more closely at two things. The first was the actual
quality of the links that were pointing back to you. They created something

called “page rank” to give a quality score to every page.^34 This made it


possible to assign a weight to every link that was pointing back to your
website. No longer would 101 links beat out 100 links; instead, if you had
fewer links coming from higher-quality pages, you could win, even with
much fewer links. This solved a lot of problems for Google and cleaned up
the results for a while, but inevitably it made people start focusing their
spamming efforts on better sites. Pretty soon, a whole underground industry
popped up where you could buy links on high page-rank sites.

Because garbage sites were rising to the top of the search engines, Google
had its spiders look more closely at the actual content that was on the

pages, not just how many links the web pages were getting.^35 Google
rewarded people who structured their web page content in a way that gave
people the best user experience. This created a whole new industry of
specialists who became amazing at doing on-page optimization, essentially
creating pages that Google loved to rank high. But, as happens with most
good things, the marketers mastered the algorithm again. They created
software that would find articles from other people’s sites, scrape the
articles, rewrite them (we used to call it “spinning” because it would take a
percentage of the words in the article, look for other words in the thesaurus
that had similar meanings, and replace the original words with the new,
similar words so it looked like a new article), and display them in a way
that would trick Google into ranking them high once again. Ultimately, it
still gave end users a bad user experience. As good as Google’s algorithm
was, people kept finding ways to beat it.

**Phase #3—The Google zoo: Panda, Penguin, Hummingbird:**^36 Starting
in about 2011, the organic “Google slap” began, meaning Google made a
bunch of huge algorithm changes designed to clean up their search results.
Each update was given the name of an animal.

It started with Panda, which killed content farms and scraper sites that
people had created to beat the algorithm. In 2012, Penguin went live,
penalizing people who were buying links or obtaining them through
networks that were designed to boost search rankings.

In 2013, Hummingbird figured out the intent behind a search rather than
just the keyword itself, giving Google the artificial intelligence it needed to


figure out what people were actually looking for. This was a huge update to
Google’s core algorithm, and it had only one goal: to make a better
experience for those who were searching for something.

**Phase #4—Mobilegeddon and Fred:** For years, Google didn’t implement
any big updates. That is, until 2015, which has been called the year of
mobile. It was the first time that mobile searches bypassed desktop searches
on Google. This was also the year that Google launched their new updated
algorithm that ranked you higher if your site was optimized for mobile.
This update forced everyone to redesign their pages to create a better
mobile experience for Google’s mobile searchers.

Two years later, we were introduced to the update that was unofficially

named Fred.^37 This update is the one that I think is most important for us
all to understand, as it gives us the pattern to be successful with search in
the future. Fred penalized sites that prioritized monetization over user
experience. If your site had low user engagement, was thin in content, or
had content heavily geared toward conversions, pop-ups, and aggressive
advertising, you lost your rankings overnight.

So, why are Fred and all its predecessors so important? They help us to see
Google’s core goal: a better user experience. If we can align with Google’s
goals, they will send us an almost unlimited amount of traffic for free.
Trying to spam the algorithms may give you short-term gains, but only
until Google finds the loopholes and closes them. However, the real secret
is understanding Google’s intent and helping them to serve their searchers.

Why does Google care so much about their users’ experience? Mostly
because they still make the majority of their money from paid ads, and if
people have a bad experience when they search, they won’t come back. So
if your goal is to try to figure out a way to deliver the best experience
possible to their surfers, Google will reward you for that.

#### STEP #2: FIND YOUR DREAM 100 ON THIS

#### PLATFORM


This is where the search engines start to become _really_ fun for me. This
process is similar to a treasure hunt, looking for the keywords and blogs
that you can tap into to bring you thousands of visitors a day, sometimes
overnight.

In Secret #2, we talked about two types of congregations. The first was
“interest-based” congregations, such as influencers, brands, and other
things that people are interested in. The second type of congregation we
discussed was “search-based” congregations. Instead of targeting
“interests,” we would be targeting keywords and keyword phrases. For
Google, we are going to be building out two Dream 100 lists. One list will
be with the top bloggers in your market, and the second list will be a list of
your Dream 100 keywords.

**Your Dream 100 (bloggers):** As I start looking at Google, before I put in
the work of getting ranked in the search engines, I want to find the people
who have already done the work, gotten ranked, and have readers who
currently read their blogs. I will be utilizing these bloggers and their blogs
in different ways, both buying my way into their traffic streams as well as
working my way in. But for now, I just want to identify them and get them
on my Dream 100 list.

Finding them can be as easy as going to Google and typing in your dream
keywords and the word “blog” after it. You’ll then see the top 10 listings in
Google and which bloggers have made it to the top.

Some of the bloggers will have their own blogs that run on their own
domain, while others will use popular blogging networks like
Medium.com. You can go to Medium.com (and other blog networks) and
search for bloggers in your market. Make this list and keep it handy, as
we’ll be leveraging these people soon.

**Your Dream 100 (keywords):** It’s now finally time to dust off your
“Dream 100” keywords that you wrote down in Secret #2 and focus on
getting access to all the traffic that is on the first page in the search engines.
Being ranked on page number one for one of your dream keywords is the
equivalent of owning Boardwalk or Park Place in Monopoly. Owning one


or more of these listings in this virtual real estate landscape can fill your
funnels with traffic for years to come.

Make a list of the keyword phrases that you think your dream customers
would be typing into Google if they were trying to find the result that your
product or service offers. When I first did this exercise with ClickFunnels,
the first 10 dream keyword phrases that I wrote down were:

```
Sales funnels
Digital marketing
Internet marketing
Online marketing
Landing page
Marketing automation
Growth hacking
Personal branding
Website traffic
Social media marketing
```
I figured that that my dream customers would be typing each of these
phrases into Google to get the same result that my product could give them,
and these became my dream keywords.

The next step was to find the long-tail keywords associated with each of
my dream keywords. Often it can be really difficult to rank for a high-
competition keyword, so I also wanted to see the long-tail keywords that
would be easier to rank at first.

To do this, take your number-one dream keyword phrase and type it into
Google. Google will suggest other keyword phrases in the search bar that
people often search for when someone types in your dream keyword
phrase. These are the other suggested phrases under your search results.

These keywords will become your “long-tail” keyword phrases. Write
down your nine long-tail keyword phrases that are associated with each of
your dream keywords that you would like to target. For example:

Dream Keyword: **Sales Funnels**


Long-Tail Keywords:

```
Sales funnels definition
Sales funnels software
Sales funnels for real estate
Sales funnels examples
Sales funnels for artists
Sales funnels templates
Sales funnels explained
Sales funnels 101
Sales funnels for Shopify
```
You can also scroll down to the bottom of Google after you search for your
dream keyword, and it will show you eight more keywords that are closely
related to your search term.

```
image
```
**Figure 12.2: When you type in your dream keyword, Google will
suggest other popular, long-tail keyword phrases (left). After searching
for a specific result, Google will also show you related searches at the
bottom of their search results (right).**

Keep looking until you find 10 solid keywords phrases to focus on. If you
do that with all 10 of your dream keywords, you will end up with a list of
100 keywords.

This is the simplest way to build out your dream keyword list, but there are
some amazing software tools that can help take it to the next level. Many of
them will show you how many searches each keyword gets each month,
how competitive it is to try and rank for these keywords, how much money
you will pay per click from the sponsored ads, and more. I have posted a
list of all my favorite keyword tools, as well as tutorial videos for my
favorites, at TrafficSecrets.com/resources.

#### STEP #3: IDENTIFY THE PUBLISHING STRATEGY

#### AND CREATE YOUR PUBLISHING PLAN


Now that we have our dream keywords, we want to funnel hack the search
engines to see what is already working for that keyword. To do that, all you
have to do is type your keyword phrase into Google. Then scan the top 10
results and look for patterns of what type of posts are being ranked. I
specifically look for what we call a “linkable asset,” or what I call
internally a “Letterman Top 10 List.”

I call it that because I remember when I was teenager and my parents
would sometimes watch _Late Show with David Letterman_ , and while I
didn’t necessary like his show, there was one segment that I _loved,_ and it
was when he would do his famous Top 10 Lists, such as “Eminem’s Top 10
Pieces of Advice For Kids” or “Top 10 Questions Justin Bieber Would

Answer ‘I Don’t Know.’”^38 Then he would list out 10 funny things to go
with each list.

A linkable asset works similar to Letterman’s Top 10 Lists. They will
usually be structured with a title like “25 SEO Tools to Instantly Improve
Your Marketing in 2020” or “18 Things You Can Actually Eat on a
Ketogenic Diet that You Assumed Were Bad for You.”

These types of linkable assets are what Google loves for a few reasons. The
first is that if you structure them correctly, people will love the content so
much that they can’t help but link back to it. Real, organic, quality links are
what Google wants to reward you for, and writing a good article that people
naturally want to link to is the secret to getting the right links. The second
reason is these are the types of posts that readers on Google love. Because
Google owns the Chrome browser and usually has their analytics code on
most of your pages, they can see how long someone stays on your site, how
long they scroll for, if they click on your links, and how many pages they
visit inside of your site. The more time someone spends on your site, the
more they scroll, and the more pages they click to are all signs that your
end user is having a good experience. These types of articles with their “21
steps” or “205 resources,” if written correctly, will get people to scroll
through your page and spend a lot of time there, showing its value to
Google.


As I’m scanning the organic results for my dream keywords, I’m looking to
see if there are any Letterman Top 10 List–type articles being ranked. If
there aren’t, then I will work on creating my own linkable asset that I can
post on my blog. If I do find one that is already ranking in the top 10 for
my Dream 100, I will use the “skyscraper” technique that I learned from
Brian Dean to build a taller skyscraper and outrank them in the search
engines.

The skyscraper technique works after you have found content that has
already generated a ton of links and is already ranking for your dream
keywords, and then you model it to create your own bigger, better piece of
content, i.e., a bigger skyscraper. I like to try to create at least one new
skyscraper article per month.

On his blog, Brian describes the skyscraper technique as a way for _you_ to

have the content that everyone wants to talk about (and link to):^39

Have you ever walked by a really tall building and said to yourself: _Wow,
that’s amazing! I wonder how big the_ eighth _tallest building in the world is._
Of course not. It’s human nature to be attracted to the best. And what
you’re doing here is finding the tallest “skyscraper” in your space... and
slapping 20 stories to the top of it.

```
image
```
**Figure 12.3: To rank for your dream keyword, find an article that is
ranked high in Google for that keyword and write a “taller
skyscraper” article that Google will like better.**

After you’ve found an article that is ranking for your dream keyword that
you want to beat, the next step is to write a better piece of content. Here are
four things that Brian recommended to do to your article to make your
skyscraper taller:

```
Longer: In some cases, publishing an article that’s simply longer or
includes more items will do the trick. For example, if you find a link
magnet with a title of “50 Healthy Snack Ideas,” publish a list of 150
(or even 500).
```

```
More up to date: If you can take an out-of-date piece of content and
spruce it up, you’ve got yourself a winner.
Better designed: A visually stunning piece of content can typically
generate a lot more links and social shares than something similar on
an ugly page.
More thorough: Most lists posts are made of a bland list of bullet
points without any meaty content that people can actually use. But if
you add a bit of depth for each item on your list, you have yourself a
list post that’s much more valuable.^40
```
**Important note:** Brian recommends that you beat the existing content on
all four levels.

In this longer new skyscraper, I will often use my dream keyword as well
as my long-tail keywords throughout the article. Doing this with just one
skyscraper article will often get me ranked for many, if not all, my related
Dream 100 keyword phrases.

**Getting quality links to your skyscraper:** Publishing the longer, better
skyscraper won’t in and of itself get your site ranked onto page number
one. After you’ve written the article, you need to promote it, and the way
you promote an article is by getting a lot of the right links to it. Brian
taught us to get the right links by looking at the links that are pointing to
the linkable asset that we modeled. If people are already linking to that
content, we know a few things.

```
They have a website in the same niche that we’re publishing.
They’re interested in the topic, because they have already linked to our
competitor.
They’ve already linked to an article on that topic, so it’s not difficult
for them to include a link to our longer, better, more updated article
too.
```
You will need to email the people linking to your competitor and ask them
to link back to you as well. You can contact them manually or you can use
a shortcut to save you time. Go to TrafficSecrets.com/ resources to find
some tools that will scrape the contact information from everyone who is
linking to your competitor.


In your email, you can let them know that you saw they linked to your
competitor and that you’d love it if they’d link to your article as well since
yours is similar but much more up to date and comprehensive. This strategy
will help you to get the right links. Here’s an example of an email that
Brian sent out to 160 people who were linking to his competitor that got
him great results:

```
image
```
**Figure 12.4: After you write your skyscraper article, you can email the
website owners of anyone who has linked to your competitor’s article
and let them know you have created a newer, better article.**

Brian said that he personalized and tweaked this template for each person
he reached out to, and out of the 160 emails he sent out, he got 17 people to
link back! That’s an 11 percent success rate following the skyscraper
method that helped him to get his article ranked.

The next way I work to get links back to my new article is by reverse
engineering (funnel hacking) the backlinks that are going to the other nine
organic listings on page number one for my dream keyword. I already
found the people that are linking to my competitor’s article and emailed
them. I am now going to do the same thing to the people who are linking to
the other nine pages that are ranked on page one. I send out a similar email
to each of them asking if they’d be willing to link back to my linkable
asset. By doing this, I am getting the same backlinks that are currently
ranking the top 10 results for my dream keyword phrase all linking back to
me.

There are lots of other ways to get links, all with varying degrees of what
Google likes. “White hat” techniques are the ones that Google loves and
rewards you for, whereas “black hat” techniques are just spammy ways to
get links that trick Google. While you may get short-term gains with black-
hat techniques, every one that I’ve ever used to beat Google has always
caught up with me eventually. We now solely focus on doing what Google
wants. I’ll mention some other ways we get links in the “work your way in”
section later, but Brian’s skyscraper linking technique is one of the best and
fastest ways to kick-start your link building.


These manual link requests will get the process started, and then I will
stimulate traffic to the skyscraper pages by promoting my new article on
my other social sites (Facebook and Instagram) and email lists. If you’ve
followed the process we’ve discussed, your content will become a link
magnet by organically getting the right types of links and continuing to rise
in the search engines. This type of organic linking is what Google wants
and rewards.

**Your Publishing Plan**

In this chapter, I’ve shown you how I look at marketing on Google. We’ve
talked about some of the core ways to get organic traffic from Google. The
following is a publishing plan that you and your team can use to systemize
the ranking process.

```

```
**Figure 12.5: Use this publishing plan to see at a glance where you
should focus your efforts on Google.**

#### STEP #4: WORK YOUR WAY IN

Working your way into the search engines has two amazing benefits. The
first is that you can tap into the traffic streams of the bloggers that you put
on your Dream 100 list earlier. The second is you can get some of the best
quality links directly from these same bloggers who have quality sites in
your market (the type of links that Google loves).

The way I work my way into the search engines is through “guest posting.”
That means I am looking for someone else who has a blog in my market
and I am asking if I can make a “guest post” on their site. I’ll email the blog
owners and tell them that I had a few cool ideas for a post on their blog and
ask them if any of them are of interest. If they say yes, then I write up the
post, include a link to one or two of my skyscrapers, and have them post it.
I give them good content, their readers will click on the links and I’ll get
traffic from that, the spiders will see the links to my skyscraper, and it will
increase my rankings from there.


You can also work on becoming a writer or a columnist for high-traffic sites
in your market. Some of the best SEO people I know are writers for
_Forbes_ , _Entrepreneur_ , and other top-ranked sites. They are able to use their
positions as writers on the sites to push traffic into their own funnels and
post quality links to rank their skyscrapers.

I try to post at least one guest post per week on blogs in my market, as well
as work toward becoming a contributing author for the sites that bring me
the most traffic and quality links.

#### STEP #5: BUY YOUR WAY IN

When I first started to learn SEO, back before the Google slaps started, I
got frustrated that I wasn’t ranked number one for some of the highly
competitive dream keywords that I wanted to rank for. One day I decided I
wanted to be number one for the keyword “internet marketing.” I set out on
a journey to rank organically for that keyword, and after eight long months
I finally ended up getting to page number one! I think I topped out at the
number four spot on page one before I got slapped during one of the
algorithm updates.

But about a month into that long journey, I got frustrated and I looked at
each of the people who were already ranked number one for my dream
keywords. I started to notice that a lot of those sites were articles and
weren’t actually selling any products. They had some banner ads on them,
but they didn’t have a product like mine to sell.

I started emailing a bunch of them, knowing how hard I was working to try
to get that ranking, wondering why they would put in that much effort to
rank when they didn’t have an actual product to sell. I got emails back from
about a half dozen of them, and I found out something very interesting.
Most of them were SEO guys who were really good at ranking pages but
had no idea how to create products. So instead they would get a page
ranked on page one, and then they would either sell ads on their page or
link to other products as an affiliate. As soon as they told me that, I had the
big idea.


What if while I was waiting to get my site ranked on page one, I started
getting traffic immediately from all the people who were currently ranked
number one? My goal in the short-term wasn’t to outrank them; it was to
get ads for my funnels on their pages.

I started to negotiate deals with them, and within days I was prominently
displayed at the top of some of the sites that were already ranked for my
dream keywords. Getting on these pages turned on a faucet of traffic over
night!

I quickly started to realize how much more valuable a click to your funnels
is from one of these pages than even the same from the Google homepage.
Just think, a phrase like “internet marketing” could have thousands of
people searching for it per day on Google. However, the people who do the
following three-step process are actually more valuable to you:

```
1. Type a phrase into Google
2. Click on one of the results
3. Click on the link to your funnel from this other page
```
```
image
```
**Figure 12.6: People who follow this three-step process of searching for
your keyword, clicking on one of the results, clicking on your paid ad**
**_inside_** **that result, and landing on your funnel are more valuable to you
because they’re warmer traffic.**

The first click on Google is typically from the “browsers” but the second
click comes from the people who are the most serious: the buyers. Because
they’ve made two clicks to get to you, they are so much more likely to
convert when they do get to your page. Tons of the clicks that hit Google’s
homepage will be wasted on people who aren’t serious, and if you’re
paying for these clicks, it can be very expensive. However, the people who
have to click two clicks to get to you are the ones who are most serious and
will be worth the most money to you long-term.

When I look at my Dream 100 websites, I try to quickly weed out the ones
that don’t have any advertising on them already. Instead, I’m looking for


sites that have AdSense ads, banner ads, affiliate links to other products,
and email newsletter subscription boxes. Then I start contacting the owners
of these websites to find out my advertising options.

```
If they have an email newsletter, I ask them if I can purchase a solo
ad to their email list (more on this in Secret #17).
If they have banner ads on their website, I ask them how much it
costs to purchase a banner ad.
If they have Google AdSense on their site, then I add their site to my
list to target later with Google Display Network or GDN (more on this
in Secret #9).
If they have an article on that page, then I try to see if I can get them
to add a link back to one of my pages in their article.
```
Getting your links to your funnels on the pages that are already ranked for
your dream keywords is one of the fastest ways to get super qualified traffic
into your funnels.

#### STEP #6: FILL YOUR FUNNEL

Are you able to see now how you can get access to the traffic that is
coming from the search engines? We focus on creating blog posts that are
linkable assets that will act as link magnets that you can get ranked on page
one for your dream keywords. While we’re waiting for these pages to rise
in the search engines, we do guest posting on the blogs in our market to get
both instant traffic from their readers and more links pointing back to our
linkable assets.

We then go to the pages that are already ranked on page one for our dream
keywords, and we work to buy ads on these pages so we can plug our
funnels into the existing streams of traffic that are going to these pages.

The last step is buying ads on Google’s paid search platforms. There are
two main ways that you can get paid traffic from Google. The first is the
paid ads on the search engine results pages (the ads that show up above and
below the organic results for your dream keywords) and the second is from


AdSense ads that other people have put on their pages. You get access to
these ads through the GDN.

I won’t be showing the actual tactics behind how to run Google Ads as they
are always changing, but the strategy behind how you run Google Ads in
Secret #9 is the same. First you create prospecting ads as hooks to capture
your dream customers and pull them into your funnels. For those that don’t
immediately convert, we move them into our retargeting buckets and move
them from engaged, to landed, and then to owned. After we own the traffic,
we use our follow-up funnels to ascend them up our value ladder.


##### SECRET #13

### YOUTUBE TRAFFIC SECRETS

There is something special about YouTube that I don’t think many people
understand. YouTube is the only platform where you can create something
and post it online where it will actually grow exponentially over time.

When you post a video on Facebook Live, it will show up in the
newsfeed of your dream customers for a few days, and then it’s gone
forever. You can extend the life of that video by paying for ads to boost it,
but eventually it will fall to the bottom of your feed, never to be seen again.
And although Facebook Live is like a good talk show for current events, the
art you create has a limited life span. The same is true with Instagram,
where eventually your pictures will fall to the bottom of your feed and your
Stories will expire. Some platforms have more longevity and last longer,
but they all perform progressively worse over time.
Every platform, that is, _except_ for YouTube. As soon as artists create
videos and post them on YouTube, their viewership can start to grow and
continue to grow forever. I have videos that I published five years ago that
still get hundreds of views a day. Other videos that we published more
recently received an initial viewer surge (we can often get thousands of
views per day simply because it’s a new video), but the numbers of new
views continue to rise day after day. YouTube’s algorithms are built to keep
people on YouTube, so they try to recommend videos that are most likely to
keep their viewers engaged as long as possible.

This gives us creators a reason to spend more time producing amazing
videos that will serve us and our audiences for the rest of our lives and
beyond. And when you understand a few key things about how YouTube’s
algorithms work, it will help you set up your videos for long-term success.


Six years ago, I got a call from a guy named Joe Marfoglio, who asked
me if he could become an affiliate for a new product I had just launched. It
was a course we had created helping people to overcome pornography
addiction. Excited to get someone else besides myself driving traffic to our
new product, I said yes. He told me that he was going to create a few videos
and post them on YouTube, driving traffic through his affiliate link to our
product.

I gave him permission and didn’t think much more about it at the time.
Within a few months, Joe was driving more sales by himself than all my
marketing efforts combined. Confused, I asked him what he was doing, and
he told me that he had just posted two videos on YouTube and that was it. I
asked him if I could see the videos and he sent me the links.
One was a short, 2-minute-and-47-second video he had created, and the
other was the sales video that I had created to sell the product. Both these
videos were getting thousands of views a day. As I was writing this chapter,
I went back to find these two videos and was shocked to see that the first
video had received 1.2 million views and the longer video had over 815,000
views!

```
Figure 13.1: In six years, this video has received over 815,000 views, and because it’s on
YouTube, it gets more views every day.
```

Despite the fact that we stopped selling that product a few years ago,
these videos continue to drive traffic every day. I had Joe pull the stats, and
that month alone, more than six years after he posted them, the videos had
10,361 views and were able to generate 553 clicks back to our funnel. That
is the power of creating videos with YouTube.

###### STEP #1: UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY AND THE GOAL

Did you know that YouTube is the world’s second largest search engine
(behind Google), and it’s also the second most trafficked website (also

behind Google)?^41 Oh, yeah, and in case you didn’t know, it’s also owned
by Google. It was created in 2005 by three PayPal employees (Chad Hurley,
Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim) above a pizzeria in San Mateo, California.^42
In less than two years after YouTube started, Google purchased it for $1.65
billion.

Right now, over 1.9 billion people log into YouTube every month, over
400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, and over one
billion hours of videos are watched on YouTube every day.
YouTube is interesting because it functions similar to a social platform.
You create content, try to get people to engage with that content and build
up subscribers just like other social networks.

YouTube also functions as a search engine, which is why, unlike social
networks, your videos continue to grow over time. If you learn how to
optimize your videos the way that YouTube would like you to, they will
reward you by ranking you for your dream keywords inside of YouTube,
and often they’ll even post those videos inside the search results of Google.

###### STEP #2: FIND YOUR DREAM 100 ON THIS PLATFORM

Six months after we had launched ClickFunnels, we were trying to figure
out new ways to get more people to create accounts. We hadn’t used
YouTube yet as a traffic strategy, so I called up Joe Marfoglio (my friend
who ranked the videos for our pornography anti-addiction product a few
years earlier) and asked him if he could help. During our initial call, he got


excited and had me jump on a videoconference where I could see his
computer screen. He opened up YouTube, and I watched as he showed me
one of the most powerful marketing tactics I had ever witnessed.

First, he typed in the names of some of the people who were on my
Dream 100 list—people who we had been targeting on Facebook to see if
they were also publishing on YouTube. Many of them didn’t have YouTube
channels, but others had really big channels with hundreds of thousands of
subscribers. As I looked at each of the videos on their channels, Joe said,
“You know you can buy ads that will be shown in front of any of those
videos, right? As soon as anyone goes to watch a video on their channel, the
first thing they will see are your ads.”
At the time I had no idea that was possible, and almost instantly my mind
wondered about the possibilities. “Wait, I can buy ads on each of their
videos and use it to bring people into my funnels?”

“Exactly,” Joe said. “You are leveraging their name, their credibility, and
their content to drive people into your funnels.”
He then went to the YouTube search bar and asked me what keywords I
thought my dream customers would be searching for. I asked him to try the
keyword “internet marketing,” and within a few seconds I saw dozens of
videos that were already ranked for that term. Joe explained how we could
easily create videos and get them ranked for these dream keywords, just like
we did for the pornography anti-addiction video. Joe said, “We can put in
the work once, and these videos will serve you for the rest of your life.
Heck, they’ll keep driving traffic to your funnels even after you’re dead!”

Laughing, I asked him, “While we’re waiting for these videos to get
ranked at the top, could I buy ads on all the other videos now?” He smiled
and politely told me yes.
Within just a few minutes, I started to see why I was going to love
YouTube so much. After I got off that call, I immediately did exactly what
I’m going to tell you to do now. You need to build out two Dream 100 lists:
one list with the names of the people, brands, and influencers that you
would like to target, and a second list with the keyword phrases that you
would like to create videos for. I’ll go into more detail on how we find the
right keywords in the publishing section later in this chapter.


###### STEP #3: IDENTIFY THE PUBLISHING STRATEGY AND CREATE

###### YOUR PUBLISHING PLAN

Just like Google, YouTube has an algorithm that decides which videos to
rank to increase their users’ experience. To prevent people from ranking
videos that ruin the experience for end users, the algorithm is constantly
being updated and changed. The way to win at YouTube is to figure out
ways to create and post videos that are in alignment with how they want
videos to be posted. That’s why it’s so important to closely watch your
Dream 100 and see what things they’re doing that YouTube is rewarding
them for. If they change how they like descriptions, tags, or linking, you’ll
see the changes in the videos that are getting a lot of views, and then you
can change your strategy to match theirs. Most of the things that I will be
showing you in this publishing section are things that I learned from Joe
Marfoglio as he’s consulted us at ClickFunnels with our YouTube strategy.

**Set Up Your Channel**

Before we start creating any videos, we need to make sure the channel is set
up so that when potential subscribers come, they’ll turn into actual
subscribers.

**Name of your channel:** For your channel name, you should focus more on
branding than keywords. Your channel name will show up everywhere in
searches, suggested searches, related channel suggestions, and on your
videos when you leave comments. You want people to be able to see your
name and brand and get a sense of what your channel is about. You’ll notice
that my channel name is Russell Brunson—ClickFunnels. I do this because
I want people to recognize my name as well as my main brand when they
see my channel name come up.

**“About Us” page:** This page is important for two reasons. First, it lets
people know more about you when they’re checking you out before they
subscribe. Second, the information you write here will show up in the
search results for your channel and will be a big key to people finding and
subscribing to your channel.


**Header image:** When people come to your channel page, the first thing
they’ll see is your header. Your header should be simple and speak clearly
to your target audience so that they know the value they’ll get from your
channel. Those who see mine will know quickly what I do and how I can
help them.

```
Figure 13.2: When people see your YouTube channel, you want them to immediately know who
you are and what you’re about.
```
**Profile image:** Many people mistakenly put their logos here. Instead, use a
picture of yourself because it will dramatically increase engagement.

**Channel trailer and description:** When people first come to your channel
page, they’ll see an actual trailer for your channel as well as a brief
description about your channel. It is only shown to new visitors who aren’t
subscribers yet, so this video is speaking specifically to them.

```
Here are Joe’s script guidelines for an engaging channel trailer:
```
```
Introduce yourself and welcome your viewer to your channel. You
want the viewer to feel like you are talking to them and that you
understand them.
Go briefly into your backstory and explain why you have the
authority to be creating the content you make on YouTube.
```

```
Pitch your value statement. Leave no doubt in your viewer’s mind
what this channel is about. Talk about the channel, what it is about, and
why it matters.
Share your posting schedule so they know when to expect new
content.
End the video with a really strong CTA. This means you need to tell
the viewer what you want them to do. Tell them to subscribe to your
channel and turn on notifications so they don’t miss any of your new
videos.
```
Make sure this video is no more than 60–120 seconds long. Any longer
than that and you will lose your potential viewer.

```
Figure 13.3: Create a short channel trailer by following this simple script: introduction,
backstory, value statement, posting schedule, and CTA.
```
When shooting this video, don’t get overwhelmed or bogged down with
details about the camera and the equipment. If you’re just starting out, you


don’t need to buy anything fancy. I still use my iPhone for the majority of
my videos.

**Identify Your Dream Keywords that You Want to Make Videos For**

The first step is to find all the long-tail keywords around your dream
keyword that you can make videos for. If you have a brand-new channel
and try to rank for a keyword like “how to make money online,” it’s going
to be extremely difficult to outrank some of the bigger channels. But Joe
has a strategy that has proven successful in the past to get you tons of
views, traction, and subscribers:

```
This is a tactic I learned from my good friend Jeremy Vest. He calls
this tactic “finding your channel’s focus phrase.” You can think of it
like trying to find your channel’s “how to shave.” What does that
mean? A lot of you have probably seen a video or heard about the
Dollar Shave Club. They made an incredible video that went viral
everywhere on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube with millions upon
millions of views, and that launched their company into the
stratosphere. But did you know another razor company was
dominating YouTube and raking in millions of views from their hyper-
targeted market and they did it without any viral or hype videos?
That company was Gillette. What they found was that the most
influential keyword in their space was “how to shave.” They centered
their channel around that keyword. Now, if Gillette just wanted to rank
for “how to shave,” they wouldn’t get a ton of traction. It would have
been really hard, right out of the gate, to rank for that keyword.
Instead, they took “how to shave” as the root keyword. Then, they
looked through suggested search terms and added words to the back of
it. Gillette created hundreds of videos with that root keyword, such as,
“how to shave your head,” “how to shave your back,” “how to shave
your beard,” “how to shave your legs,” and so on. Gillette made video
after video with the root word “how to shave.” These videos have
collectively received millions of views across their channel.
```

**The dream keyword “ABC Hack”:** Here’s a trick to find hundreds of
keywords you can choose from. If my root keyword is fairly broad, like
“how to make money,” you can type in the same words in the YouTube
search bar followed by a space and the letter _a_.

```
The suggested search results will show you: “How to make money.. .”
```
```
As a beginner
As a kid
At home
At school
```
Then you can replace the _a_ with _b_ , and the suggested search results will
show you: “How to make money.. .”

```
Blogging
By investing
By posting ads
```
Then move on to _c_ and _d_ and so on. You will want to get at least 50 of
these “how to make money” keywords to use as keyword titles in your
videos.

**Create Your First Video**

Now that you’ve done all the research, set up your channel, and made a list
of keywords to target, now it’s time to start creating videos. As I’m creating
videos, there are two types of video that I focus on.
The first are called “discoverable videos.” These are videos based on
keyword phrases that I publish as hooks to rank for these keywords with a
goal of grabbing people’s attention, pulling them into my channel, and
turning them into subscribers. How you structure these videos is very
important because if one of them takes off and gets 100K views, you want
to be able to make sure that you are able to create subscribers and leads
from all of these viewers.


Here is the script that Joe created that I use for every discoverable video
we create:

```
Figure 13.4: To create a discoverable video, simply follow this five-step script outline: hook,
trailer, intro, story/content, and offer.
```
```
Hook: Create a 15-second concise introduction. This is where you’re
going to hook people using the same keywords that they’re searching
for. You’ll tell them the value of your video and present a hook for
them to look forward to so they continue watching.
Trailer: Place your quick branded intro or “trailer,” which should be
no more than four to five seconds maximum. Do not put a 30- or 60-
second branded intro here. You’ll lose the majority of your viewers
right there.
Intro: Talk to your viewer about who you are and why they should
listen to you for the next 15–30 seconds. Share a little bit about your
story so that you make a connection with that new visitor. Don’t
assume that they know who you are.
```

```
Story/Content: Share content and story for the next 7 to 12 minutes.
Here is where you deliver the value from the hook you mentioned
earlier.
Offer: Add your CTA. As a discoverable video, the offer will normally
be to get people to like, comment, subscribe, or turn on the
notifications.
```
Use this show formula as an outline to write out your video script. Once
you have an outline and a tight script, take out your cell phone or camera,
look right into the lens, and film yourself recording that video. The goal of
these videos is to hook people who are searching and direct them back to
your “home” to become subscribers. Typically, I’m not selling on these
videos, outside of selling the subscription to my channel.

The second type of video I create is called “video webinars,” which are
usually less keyword focused, as they are created to build a stronger
relationship with my current subscribers. These videos are the ones that I’m
posting for my existing followers, at my home. These are the videos that I
use to sell things. I’ll still try to find keywords to rank them for, but
oftentimes I am trying to create or teach something that may not fit inside
of a certain keyword phrase. I use the Perfect Webinar script, or the Perfect
Webinar Hack, or the Perfect Five-Minute Webinar (all from _Expert Secrets_ ,
and you can print the scripts at TrafficSecrets.com/resources) with a goal of
moving them from traffic that I’ve earned into traffic that I own.

```
Figure 13.5: To create a video webinar, you can still follow the five-step script from earlier, but
instead of asking your subscribers to like, comment, or subscribe, you’ll encourage them to get
a lead magnet.
```

**Upload Your Video and Set It Live**

After I’ve created the video, there are six things that we currently do for
each video we upload to make sure we’re aligned with YouTube’s
algorithm.

**Look at YouTube as a TV show:** YouTube very much sees itself like a TV
station. Unlike Facebook Live where you can go live anytime you want,
YouTube wants you to create a show, schedule it, and publish it on a
consistent schedule. For example, you may publish your videos every
Thursday at 7:00 P.M. EST, or every Tuesday and Thursday at 7:00 A.M. EST.
Create a schedule for yourself that you know you can keep up with, and be
consistent as you stick to that publishing schedule.

**Find the keyword for your new video:** Make sure you have identified the
keyword phrases you want to use for your new video. Earlier we walked
you through how to find these phrases, and now we’re ready to use them.

**Write your video title:** Your title should have two elements: it must
contain your keyword phrase, and it also needs a strong hook that works in
tandem with your thumbnail to “sell the click.” For example, if I were
trying to create a video that would rank for “potato gun,” some possible
titles might be:

```
“Potato Gun—The 17 steps to build your gun in under an hour”
or
“How to build your Potato Gun with stuff you can find at Home Depot
for under $30”
```
**Create your thumbnail “hook”:** This is the visual hook that will grab
people when they’re watching someone else’s video to convince them to
watch your video next. Make sure it looks good when it’s shrunken down
tiny. The best practices that usually get the most clicks are using large
faces/images, bright colors, and as few words as possible. It needs to pop
off the page. Look at your Dream 100’s video thumbnails to get an idea of
how they’re grabbing attention with their thumbnails.


```
Figure 13.6: When creating thumbnails, be sure to have clear hooks with an image of your face
to get more clicks.
```
**Write your description:** Ideally, these will be between 150–300 words.
The first two sentences should contain your keyword and CTA because this
portion is “above the fold,” i.e., the portion that everyone sees before they
scroll down. You will also want to add your subscribe link and a link to
your front-end funnels, as well as links to other related videos and playlists
you have on YouTube. To optimize your search results, I recommend
adding up to three hashtags.

**Add tags:** While still helpful for search ranking, tags mean less than they
used to. Keep your tags highly relevant to your main keyword: the more
closely related to the topic, the better. If you branch out, you’ll only confuse
the algorithm.


```
Figure 13.7: Just as important as the video itself is the content about the video, such as the
keywords, title, description, and tags.
```
Those are the core things that we’re looking at when posting each video.
Again, these specific things may change, so that’s why it’s so essential to
closely watch your Dream 100 to see what things are being rewarded in
YouTube and then make changes as needed.

After your video is posted, you want to get people watching it as soon as
possible. I’ll usually encourage the traffic that I own, such as my email lists,
fans, and followers, to watch the new video. Because these are your best
fans, they’ll likely watch more of the video, like more, comment more, and
share more—all those things that will show the algorithm that your video is
good. After your initial surge of traffic to the video, YouTube will start
posting it in the side bar of videos that are related, and they will often rank
it for the keywords that you are targeting.
YouTube’s algorithm will then watch and see how your video performs.
The better it does, the more they’ll reward it. Here are the three things
we’ve noticed that have the biggest impact on your video’s success:


```
Click-Through Rate (CTR): How many people who see your
thumbnail actually click on it? The benchmarks we want for CTR are:
```
```
4 percent—Acceptable
6 percent—Good
9 percent—We should throw a party!
```
```
Initial retention: The first minute of retention is very important.
You need to hook people fast and keep them watching. Watch the
videos from your Dream 100 to get ideas on how they hook people
past the first minute. Try to keep minute one retention above 70
percent.
```
```
Overall retention: As for your overall video retention, how long is
the actual video being watched? We look at how many people make it
to the end of the video. The benchmarks for video retention are:
```
```
35 percent—Acceptable
40 percent—Good
50 percent—Party time! (You’ll get a lot more reach if your account
averages this or better)
```
**The “Binge-Watching”YouTube Hack**

One of the best things you can do for your channel is to get people to binge-
watch your videos. When YouTube sees people going from one video in
your channel to another, and another, not only will it boost your views on
those videos, it will lift the entire channel.
One secret is instead of putting up a longer, 30- or 60-plus minute video,
create a YouTube playlist and break up your long videos into smaller 5–10
minute videos that are part of a series inside of that playlist. Then when
someone watches the first video on the playlist, it automatically directs
them to video two in the series, and when that video ends, it directs them
into video three, and so on. This gets people watching a half dozen or more
videos on your channel in a row and boosts all your rankings across your
channel!


It’s very simple to set up a playlist in YouTube, add your videos, and
promote the new “series” to the traffic you own. Think of the ripple effect
that promoting a new playlist to binge-watch will create.

```
It’s a huge value add to your own list and will build a better
relationship with your viewers.
It gets your hottest subscribers watching your newest videos, which
should give you higher initial and overall retention than a cold viewer
who finds you on YouTube.
You’re likely to get more likes and comments from these viewers,
especially if you ask them to engage in these ways in the emails and
messages you send to them promoting this new series.
Most of them will move through each video in the playlist because
they’re excited to see your new series, which will make these videos
rank higher, which will also boost your entire channel.
```
This becomes such a big win-win-win for you, your viewers, and
YouTube that we try to build launching a new playlist that viewers can
binge-watch into our publishing plan at least once per month.

**Your Publishing Plan**

In this chapter, you’ve seen how you can create videos on YouTube that
will rank for your dream keywords on both Google and YouTube. Each
week you should be launching new discoverable videos to target your
dream keywords, and each month launching a playlist where you can teach
your subscribers, boost your rankings, and give them something awesome
to watch. I’m including a YouTube publishing plan so you can see how to
weave it into your daily and weekly processes.


```
Figure 13.8: Use this publishing plan to see, at a glance, where you should focus your efforts on
YouTube.
```
###### STEP #4: WORK YOUR WAY IN

The core way we work our way in to YouTube is by following the
publishing plan we just laid out. Every day, we’re picking new keywords
we want to rank for, and then we go and create videos to target these
keywords. If you are consistent in publishing these videos, you will
continue to show up in the search results for more keyword phrases, more
people will subscribe to your channel, and your videos will keep growing.

Similar to Instagram, you can also do collabs with other channels where
you can make a video with another influencer and have them post it to their
channel with links pointing back to you. Sometimes we will do a swap with
collabs where I will post a video on my channel linking to them, and then
they will post one linking back to us, but it doesn’t always have to be a one-


for-one swap. Often, I’ll have someone post a video for me on their channel
in exchange for featuring them on my podcast. That way they get exposure
on my primary show, and I get exposure on theirs. There are lots of ways to
make collabs work; you just need to be creative and figure out how to make
it a win-win for both of you.

###### STEP #5: BUY YOUR WAY IN

One of my favorite YouTube shortcuts is to find videos that are getting a lot
of views, but where the creators of the videos don’t really understand how
to make money from their views. For example, a few years ago I purchased
a website called Vygone.com. I went on YouTube and found that there was
a customer who had bought the product and had made a video using it. At
the time, the video was getting hundreds of views per day, yet there were no
links or a description or anything.

I called her up and asked her if I could pay her to put a link in the
description back to my new website. She agreed, and almost five years later,
this video still sends me hundreds of clicks each month.

```
Figure 13.9: After noticing that someone else’s video about my new company, Vygone, was
getting a lot of views, I paid the video owner so I could place my funnel’s link inside her video
description.
```

There are plenty of other ways to buy your way in; you just need to use
your creativity. You could pay people to create a video and post it on their
channel for you. You could even pay them to let you put a playlist with a
video series on their channel. The ideas and opportunities are endless!

###### STEP #6: FILL YOUR FUNNEL

Every video you post on YouTube will extend your reach, and if you take
the time to optimize them correctly, the videos will continue to drive traffic
to you for the rest of your life. It all starts with consistently publishing
keyword-based discoverable videos to get you a spot on the organic listings,
as well as the Google search results. We use paid ads to place our ads on top
of the other videos that are ranked for our dream keywords and the videos
of our Dream 100.

We will use the same paid ads strategy on these videos that you learned
about in Secret #9: we will put out prospecting ads to hook our dream
clients, move them into the retargeting buckets where we will turn them
into traffic that we own, and then we will ascend them up our value ladder.


##### SECRET #14

### AFTER THE SLAPS AND THE SNAPS

So what happens if you’re reading this book, and Facebook has recently
been shut down by the government for controlling too big of a monopoly or
a new social platform is getting traction and you want to figure out how to
get in early before it’s too late? As you know, my goal with this book is not
to give you a fish, but it is to teach you how to fish. In my 15 years online,
I’ve watched as dozens of networks and hundreds of ads sources have come
and gone. With all this change, we’ve not only survived, but we’ve thrived.
The reason we’ve been able to weather the storms and get in front of the
traffic trends is because of the principles you’ve been learning in this book.

Even though we talked about it during the introduction of this section and
you’ve seen it conceptually over the last few chapters, in this chapter I want
to give you the exact blueprint we use as we look at every new traffic
opportunity. For this example, I am going to apply the Fill Your Funnel
framework to grow and monetize my podcast. To do that, I need to apply
this framework to the Apple podcast directory. As I break down how to
dominate the podcast network, notice how we use the same framework in
order to have success.


```
Figure 14.1: In this section, we’ll use the Fill Your Funnel framework to show how it relates to
podcasting.
```
###### STEP #1: UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY AND THE GOAL

Each show type and platform has its own positives and negatives, but of all
the platforms, podcasting is my personal favorite. It’s actually harder to
grow subscribers on your podcast than on any of the other platforms, but I
believe the subscribers you do get are way more valuable. When people
listen to your podcast, they are plugging you into their ears during a part of
their day when you usually get to have their sole attention, such as when
they’re driving, working out in the gym, or lying in bed thinking. During
these most intimate moments, you have the ability to tell stories, break false
beliefs, and really serve people in a manner that I don’t think you can do
with any other type of media.
Podcasting tends to attract a more affluent audience and people who have
a higher net worth. In fact, a recent survey showed that podcast listeners are
45 percent more likely to have a net household income of over $250,000

per year.^43 That tells me a few things. First, if you want to increase your
own personal net income, you should be listening to podcasts instead of


radio. Second, your dream customers, the cream of the crop, are those on
your list who also listen to podcasts.

When someone comes into my world (i.e., joins my list), one of the first
things I try to get them to do is to subscribe to my _Marketing Secrets_
podcast. If I can take them off whatever platform they found me, have them
leave their inbox, and have them plug me into their ears, I’ll be able to have
more of an influence than anything else I could possibly do.

###### STEP #2: FIND YOUR DREAM 100 ON THIS PLATFORM

Podcasting is one of the easiest platforms to find your Dream 100 on,
because almost every podcast is published in the Apple podcast directory,
so you don’t have to look far. Most people will also include their podcast in
other directories like Stitcher, iHeartRadio, and Spotify, but because it’s rare
that a podcast would be listed on one of those directories and not on Apple,
I do all my searches on Apple.
Apple’s ranking algorithm for podcasts is currently based on three things.
First (and most important) is the number of new subscribers. The more new
subscribers you get, the higher your podcast will rank. That is the number-
one factor and trumps the other two, so much so that my main goal is to get
people to go and subscribe. We do contests, give away prizes, and talk
about it in every show episode. The other two ranking factors are number of
downloads and the number of new comments. Both of those are important,
but not nearly as important as the number of new subscribers. If you focus
on that, then the comments and the downloads will follow.

To find your Dream 100, Apple will show you 200 of their “top”
podcasts for each category, and this gives you a huge list to use for your
Dream 100. Even those that aren’t listed in the top 200 can still have
thousands of downloads per episode. I also recommend searching for other
keywords to find shows that for some reason have a lot of downloads and
legacy subscribers but aren’t getting new subscribers, and therefore aren’t
showing up high in the rankings. They can have huge faithful followings
even though they aren’t ranked in the top 200.
Get to know your Dream 100 personally and they will become your
strategic board on how to get and keep your podcast ranked. Share with


them your wins and what’s working for you, and they’ll be more likely to
share their wins with you as well. When the platforms have ups and downs,
it’s very useful to be able to talk to others in your same market on the same
platform who are testing the algorithms and trying to figure them out as
well.

###### STEP #3: IDENTIFY THE PUBLISHING STRATEGY AND CREATE

###### YOUR PUBLISHING PLAN

The strategy with podcasting is pretty simple compared to other platforms:
you just have to decide which type of podcast you want to host. My guess is
that if you listen to a lot of podcasts, then you probably have your own
favorite format. Some people love interview-style shows, others would
rather use the time to just share their own thoughts, yet still others like to do
a blend of both. I don’t think it really matters which format you want to do,
as long as you pick something that you can be consistent with.

When I first launched my original _Marketing in Your Car_ podcast, I did it
because I knew that every day I was going to be in my car for 10 minutes.
Therefore, I knew I could commit to recording at least three episodes a
week on my phone. If it wasn’t something simple, I knew I wouldn’t be
consistent. I have other friends who love interview-style shows, and thus
needed to build out their own little studio in their house. After they had the
studio, they knew that they would be consistent. Whatever type of podcast
you choose, make sure you set up your environment for success.
As with most things in life, consistency is the key to having success with
a podcast. Podcasts have a compounding effect. Each episode that you
publish will hook new fans, who will then go backward and binge-listen to
your show from the beginning. Because of that, each episode’s audience
will be bigger than the last, and each show will indirectly promote your past
shows. For example, all the episodes I published when no one was listening
six years ago still get hundreds of listens per day from the people who are
finding out about my show today.

**Your Publishing Plan**


As with all the other publishing plans, you can follow them to a T, or you
can change them to make them work for you. With podcasting, you’ll want
to make sure you choose a consistent publishing schedule. Your listeners
will come to anticipate when your upcoming shows will be released, so help
build that trust by publishing your show on the same day(s) each week.

```
Figure 14.2: Use this publishing plan to see at a glance where you should focus your efforts on
podcasting.
```
###### STEP #4: WORK YOUR WAY IN

The one thing that’s a little harder with podcasting than any other platform
is there isn’t a really simple way to promote and build a podcast, at least not
for most people. You can’t just put out a good episode and hope that people
share it organically like all the other social channels, and most people don’t
go into Apple Podcasts daily searching for new stuff. The average podcast
listener subscribes to six shows, and that’s it. Usually, they start listening to
a show based on a recommendation from a friend. If they like the


experience, they’ll search for a few other related shows. They will “max
out” their available listening time with a few new shows, which will
become the shows they consume from that point in time moving forward.
Typically, the only way they will add a new show is if it’s recommended by
a friend or if they hear about it on another podcast.

This is why many people who have tried podcasting stop because it’s so
hard to get the initial traction and long-term growth. For those that
understand the principles you’ve learned so far in this book, though, it’s
actually really easy.
Our strategy to grow our podcast following: build our Dream 100 list of
podcasts that our dream customers were already listening to, and then go
and work our way in. We messaged every podcast that we could find in our
industry and asked them if I could be interviewed on their podcast. When I
was interviewed, I was asked the question that almost every podcast host
asks: “For those who have enjoyed this episode, how can they learn more
about you?” And my answer was always the same: “I have my new podcast
called _Marketing Secrets_ , and if you go to MarketingSecrets.com or search
for me here in Apple Podcasts, you can subscribe and get my best
marketing secrets twice a week!”

And just like we thought, the podcast listeners who heard the interview
and connected with me came in droves. They loved podcasts, they loved to
rate and review podcasts, they shared their favorite podcasts with their
friends, and they did all the things that we had been trying to educate our
non-podcasts listeners to do without any coaching.
Recently I watched with fascination as the very famous podcaster Jordan
Harbinger (who had one of the biggest podcasts in the world called _The Art
of Charm_ that was getting over 4 million monthly downloads) got into a
fight with his business partner and eventually got kicked out of his own

show.^44 I felt so bad, knowing how much work he must have spent over the
past few years growing a podcast to that size and then losing it all. Then
one day I was listening to my favorite podcast, _Mixergy_. On it, Andrew
Warner interviewed Jordan about his podcast, how he grew it initially, and
how he lost it.
Then at the end of the show, Andrew asked him what listeners should do
if they wanted to follow Jordan after the show. Jordan suggested they


should subscribe to his new show called _The Jordan Harbinger Show_.

Right then, I realized that he was doing the exact same thing that I had
been doing. He understood that all his faithful future followers were already
listening to podcasts, and he just had to go out there and convince them that
he was worth listening to. Then I started to watch as Jordan hit the podcast
circuit and was on show after show after show. In just a matter of months,
Jordan’s new show had passed over 3 million downloads.

###### STEP #5: BUY YOUR WAY IN

This next section almost didn’t make it into the book because I was too
blind to see it until last week. My second favorite podcast is called _Business
Wars_. Last week, at the end of one of their episodes, they took me to a mini
episode that they had just published. It started with the show host’s voice
saying that they had a very special episode that the Business Wars team
wanted to share from a guy named Jordan Harbinger!^45 Then they told their
whole audience that they were going to play a few highlights from Jordan’s
show that they thought everyone would like. Finally, they encouraged
everyone who was listening to go and subscribe to Jordan’s podcast if they
wanted more information!

As you can probably guess, I started to freak out, jumping around, as I
realized for the first time that you could buy ads in other people’s podcasts
to promote your podcast! We are now buying ads as well as full episodes on
the podcasts that our dream customers are listening to.

###### STEP #6: FILL YOUR FUNNEL

Now that you have your podcast and you know how to grow your
following, I want to spend a little time talking about how you can leverage
your podcast and other people’s podcasts to fill your funnel. Even if you
don’t have your own podcast show, you can still leverage this powerful
platform to get traffic.
The strategies to promote your funnels are the same as how we grow the
show. Every time I have a new book launch, a new webinar, or a new funnel


that I quickly want to get a lot of traffic for, one of the best ways to do so is
to hit up the podcast circuit. You can message hosts and see if they can get
you on their show. Once you’re on, when they ask you the magic question
about how people can learn more about you, simply tell them to get a copy
of your book, register for your webinar, or get your free lead magnet. Then
give them the URL of your funnel.

You can also purchase podcast ads to promote your podcast or any of
your other funnels. Recently, we ran a few tests for paid ads on John Lee
Dumas’s _Entrepreneur on Fire_ podcast. They did so well that we ended up
buying an entire year’s worth of ads from him! We’re also going back to the
shows that I did interviews on that had the biggest impact on sales, and
buying ads from them. Lastly, we’re buying ads on _Mixergy_ and other
podcasts that I love.
Some podcasts run their ad department in house, where you can contact
the show directly. They’ll usually have a media kit that will show you
information such as the demographics of the show and how many
downloads they get per episode. Many podcasters work with agencies to
sell their ads. Most agencies will sponsor many different shows and they
can open the doors to many other podcasts that you may not have known
even existed.

###### A NOTE ABOUT OTHER PLATFORMS

I desperately wanted to write chapters in this book about some of the other
platforms that were market leaders at one time, like Twitter, Snapchat, and
LinkedIn. There is still so much opportunity on all these platforms, and
some of them may come back and beat out the ones that I did show in this
book.

I also had a desire to talk about some of the newer platforms that I think
are going to be huge, like Twitch or TikTok, or even a platform such as
Pinterest that many ClickFunnels users get the majority of their traffic from.
But I knew that if I tried to write a chapter on every exciting platform, this
book would be over 2,000 pages long. In addition, it would have felt more
like me trying to give people “fish” than teaching them how to fish, because
these platforms have only existed during a quick snapshot in time.


I picked Facebook, Instagram, Google, and YouTube so you could see the
strategy behind how we attack each network as they come out. With that
knowledge, you now have a process you can follow for any new network
you decide to jump into and a process for how to recover during the next
Google slap or Zanos snap.


##### SECRET #15

### CONVERSATION DOMINATION

Before we go further, I do want to give you one word of warning. Many
people think that they have to be on _all_ platforms to be successful. That is
not true. In fact, the majority of the times, the opposite is true. Often, people
will try to publish and buy ads on all the platforms and never get great at
publishing on any of them, or their ad dollar is spread so thin across all of
them that they never actually get any traction.

For each business, there should be _one_ primary channel that you focus
on. It will likely be the same platform that you’ve already created your
show on during Secret #7. This will also probably be the same platform that
you spend most of your own personal time on, because you’ve been a
consumer of media on that platform, so it will be easier for you to see how
to become a producer of media on it as well. Right now, all your focus,
from your Dream 100 to paying for ads, should be on that one platform.
I can already hear some of you saying, “But, Russell, you’re publishing
on every platform. I see your podcast, your YouTube videos, your blogs,
your Facebook Lives, and your Instagram Stories. You’re not practicing
what you preach.”

I want you to understand that while I do publish on all these platforms
now, I didn’t at first. If I had, I never would have become “Russell
Brunson,” whatever that means. Five years ago when we first launched
ClickFunnels, we picked one platform and doubled down on it, and for us,
that was Facebook. We focused on building our Dream 100 there,
understanding the strategy and creating our publishing plan. We then
worked hard to “work our way in” and “buy our way in” to each person in
our Dream 100. It was a long hard process that helped us to build a
company that did over $100 million in sales _before_ we started publishing on


platform number two. About that time, we decided to take this little podcast
that I had been publishing for a while and start working on it. We had to
find our Dream 100, figure out the strategy, work our way in, buy our way
in, and create a publishing plan. As you can tell, the pattern repeats itself.

And then we repeated the process with Instagram, and later our blog.
Each new channel required a new Dream 100, new strategies, and a new
team. Had we done them all at once, we would have crumbled under the
weight of it all. So for those of you who are reading this section now, know
that for you, if you were sitting in front of me right now, I’d have you pick
one platform, build your show on it, get to work on your Dream 100, and
then only focus on that for at least the next 12 months of your life.
The other thing I often hear is: “But, Russell, I’m just going to record a
video, and then I’ll post the video to YouTube, rip the audio for my podcast,
and transcribe the audio for my blog post. I’ll just create the content once,
and then I’ll post it everywhere.” While the concept is very sexy, and there
are many people selling this as the best way to be everywhere at all times,
by doing it you are missing the understanding that each platform has its
own unique language. Usually content that works really well on one
platform will fail when copied to another one.

People on Facebook want to hear your personal stories, talk about current
events, and watch you go live. People who listen to podcasts are used to
listening to longer-form interviews. People who read blogs are looking for
longer-form content that is usually structured in a list with lots of examples
and details. People on Instagram want images and to see behind the scenes
of your journey and your life. Lastly, people on YouTube are looking for
keyword-driven how-tos and entertainment. If you just rip your keyword-
heavy YouTube video and put the audio on your podcast, it will seem
strange to someone who listens to podcasts, and really weird when someone
reads it as a status update on your Facebook wall.
Instead, focus on one platform until you’ve mastered it, which means that
you’ll know your Dream 100, your content strategy will be systemized and
happening on autopilot, and you’ll have a process in place to work your
way in and the people in place to start buying your way in. After that is
completed, then you can and should add in the next layer. Eventually, you’ll
want to be omnipresent on each platform. Personally, what I really want is


for someone to pick up their phone, and no matter which app they open, the
first person they see will be me. But if you make that jump too quickly, it
will more than likely cripple you before you have a chance to really build
your following.

###### THE PROCESS TO ACHIEVE CONVERSATION DOMINATION

I’ve seen people try to be omnipresent on every platform, and they usually
try to do it in one of three ways.

First, they publish a primary show and then publish that same
information in different formats to every network. You can get some
success with this, but your efforts will be watered down, at best. The second
way is publishing completely unique content on each platform. While this is
possible, it usually requires building a huge team of people to accomplish it,
and it will take a ton of your own personal time. For a few years, this is
what I did with my team. But after a while I got tired of producing so much
stuff all the time, until one day I had an idea.
What if we created a master show that we streamed on Facebook and
Instagram Live that was scripted out to have all the individual assets we
needed for each core platform? Then we could prepare all week for the
show and stream it live, where our team would have all the assets they
needed to make unique content that fit the native language for each
platform. And that’s when the _Marketing Secrets Live_ show was born.


```
Figure 15.1: To create content for my entire team to repurpose, I go live once a week to create a
master show.
```
I look at this show as if it’s a talk show like _The Tonight Show_. I like to
go live, because the energy when you go live versus a pre-recorded video
always comes off better. I’ll start the show and spend a few minutes waiting
for people to jump on the live feed, talk about a few current events, and
then I begin the official show.

**Monologue:** I start with my monologue, similar to how most talk shows
start, where the host gets up, tells some stories, and tries to connect with the
audience. My monologue is structured very similar to how I do my
_Marketing Secrets_ podcast. When the monologue is over, this piece of
content will become a future episode on the podcast.

**Interview:** I will typically interview someone on the show, either in the
office or over the phone. This interview matches the native language that
people are used to listening to on a podcast, so in post-production we’ll turn


this interview into another podcast episode. The monologue and interview
become the two podcast episodes that I post every week.

**Q & A Collabs:** Before we start the live show, I send a few of my Dream
100 a question by video on my phone, where I ask them to respond to the
question and send a question back to me. I show their question live and give
them my response, and then I ask them my question and show their video
response. After the show is done, we post the edited video on IGTV and tag
them, and then they will post it to their IGTV and tag me back.

**Top 10 List:** I pull a “David Letterman” and share a top list. The list I am
sharing is going to become my skyscraper article for my blog. I may share
the “21 Best Things You Can Post on Twitter to Get More Followers,” or
“My 13 Favorite Squeeze Pages for 2020.” I show an image of each item
and talk briefly about it, and when the segment is done, my team will take it
and quickly use my explanations to write the skyscraper post in my voice
and start the link-building process.

**How-Tos:** I look at the keywords that I want to rank for on YouTube and do
a segment showing two to three different ways to do things. Every how-to
will become a YouTube video targeting a specific keyword phrase that we
will post and then rank.

**Image Stories:** I go through my JK5 categories and show at least one
image per category and tell the story behind it. That gives my team a better
understanding about the image’s meaning when they are writing the
captions and trying to get people to engage with it.

**Quotes:** I like to start wrapping up the show by sharing my favorite quotes
and explaining why they are my favorites. That way if my team turns them
into quote cards, they will have good explanations that they can use from
my own words to post in the captions.

**Final Thoughts:** This is one piece that I don’t repost anywhere. I just
remember seeing Jerry Springer do it on his show back in the day (yes, I
used to watch Jerry Springer, please don’t judge me), and it was the thing


that would get me to watch the full show.^46 I want to keep something
special for our live viewers to keep them engaged until the end.

When the show is over, we quickly record all the information that my
team will need to bridge together the content for each platform. For
example, I will record quick introductions for the two podcast episodes with
“Hey, everyone, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the Marketing
Secrets podcast. In this episode, I am going to interview _________ about
_________. Be sure to listen to the end to find out his number-one secret
about _________.”
I will also record intros like this for the YouTube videos, setting up the
“how-to” they are about to watch by saying something like, “Hey, this is
Russell Brunson and I want to welcome you to my channel. Today, I’m
going to show you guys how to _________, but before I do, be sure to
subscribe to my channel and turn on the notifications so you don’t miss my
next amazing video that is coming out soon. Now let’s jump into the video.”

I may also record a quick outro for these videos that says something like,
“Thanks again for watching this video. Be sure to like the video, and post in
the comments telling me about the last time you [something related to the
video].”
By creating this show once per week, my team has all the customized
content that they need for each platform.

###### PUBLISHING AND DREAM 100 ON EACH PLATFORM

Can you see how you can use this master show and leverage it to create the
content for your primary show as well as all your secondary shows? Even
with that plan, I wouldn’t try to launch on all five platforms at one time. Go
about it slowly and methodically. As you decide to branch into each new
platform, follow the steps in the Fill Your Funnel framework:

```
Step #1: Understand the history and the goal of the new platform
Step #2: Find and model your Dream 100
Step #3: Identify the publishing strategy and create your publishing
plan
```

```
Step #4: Work your way in
Step #5: Buy your way in
Step #6: Fill your funnel
```
###### YOUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND TRAFFIC THAT YOU

###### OWN

The last and arguably most important step in your strategy is the promotion
of your primary show and secondary, supporting content. Publishing on
each platform will give you limited distribution to your fans and followers,
but in order to help stimulate growth of whatever show you have just
published (and the more you can push eyeballs to the new episode), the
more each platform will reward you for that work.

Outside of your friends, fans, subscribers, and followers on each
platform, we have a few other distribution channels that we’ve been
working on building.

**Email:** Email is the traffic that we own, and it’s one of our core distribution
channels. After people have moved through your Soap Opera Sequences,
they should be on your daily Seinfeld broadcast list. This list is the one that
you will promote your new show on as soon as it’s ready to direct a huge
surge of new people to your content and help stimulate its growth. Typically
these are the people who have the best relationship with you, so having
them viewing, liking, commenting, and sharing early after you launch the
show will tell the algorithm of any network that this content is good and
should be rewarded with more organic growth.

**Messenger:** While you’re renting your Messenger list from Facebook, and
they could take it away if they don’t like how you’re publishing to it, it is
still the most powerful channel today. The open rates and click-through
rates are second to none. Using your Messenger list to promote your new
content is one of the fastest ways to boost your new episode.

**Desktop Push:** If you’ve been building a list with desktop push
notifications, it’s another great way to promote your content when it goes


live.

Make sure the part of your content launch strategy is to use your own
distribution channels to promote your content on each platform as it goes
live. This will always give it the best chance of getting an organic lift free
from the platforms as well as getting it ready for the paid ads that you want
to run toward it. Having views, comments, and likes before the paid ads get
turned on will make each dollar you spend more effective.

Here is a breakdown of how we run our conversation domination
publishing plan that allows us to be in front of everyone on each channel
they subscribe to. To help you prepare for your own show, please go to Traf

use.

##### SECTION THREE

### GROWTH HACKING

Welcome to the third section of this book! I’m so excited to have you here.
So far, you’ve learned who your dream customers are, where they’re
congregating, how to get your hooks in front of them, and how to turn all
your traffic into traffic that you own. In Section Two, we talked about the
framework we use to get traffic from any advertising platforms to get
unlimited traffic into your funnels. We also showed you how to create
publishing plans so you could consistently show up in front of your dream
customers. Now, we finally get to move into growth hacking.
What is growth hacking, though? I’m smiling to myself, because when I
got started online 15 years ago, we didn’t have Facebook. The Google slap
had crippled most of our companies, so we had to figure out other ways to
get traffic into our funnels. We tried and tested everything. Some things
were super “black hat,” and while they weren’t anything bad, they were
frowned on by companies like Google. For instance, we would set up
cloaked pages that would trick the search engine’s spiders into thinking our
pages were perfectly optimized for search. However, when real people (who
didn’t come from a search engine spider’s IP address) would show up, they
would see a completely different squeeze page that was optimized for
conversion. We built link farms to get our pages ranked at all costs. We
figured out ways to get emails past spam filters and delivered into our
subscribers’ inboxes.

But it wasn’t just black-hat techniques that we played with; we also spent
countless hours working on getting free PR that would push people from
TV, radio, and top online news sites into our funnels. We tried everything
we could think of: black hat, white hat, and about a thousand shades of gray
in between.


For us, it was a battle of life or death. If we didn’t figure out how to get
eyeballs to our pages, we didn’t eat. All the tricks and hacks that we tried
were looked down on by “real” businesses. Some called us spammers,
while others were harsher and called us scammers. We didn’t know what to
call it, so we just called it “internet marketing.”

Those are the days that I’ll never forget. It was the Wild West, and we
were there early, way before our time. I played on this playground for
almost a decade before what we did was considered cool. When I first heard
the term “growth hacking,” some writers had published articles talking
about some of the fast-growth startup companies like Dropbox, Uber,
PayPal, and Airbnb.
Once people shared their amazing growth-hacking techniques for quickly
growing their companies, I started to laugh out loud. Every “hack” they
shared was a basic technique we had been doing for over a decade! Many of
these hacks were the same things that others used to shame us for, but they
had now become cool. Because of ClickFunnels’s rapid growth, many
people have told me we are a unicorn because we have such a unique
growth strategy, which is that we don’t grow through funding; we grow by
hacking.

In this last section, I’ll share with you the most powerful white-hat
growth-hacking techniques that we still use to this day. Even though these
appear to be new growth hacks to many, we’ve been mastering them for the
past 15 years. In truth, our success comes from going backward, diving
deep into the playbook that we wrote before the term _growth hacking_ was
even cool. Have fun with these hacks, as they’re incredibly powerful and
will give you an advantage against anyone who wants to compete against
you.


##### SECRET #16

### THE FUNNEL HUB

When I first started playing this internet marketing game, there were two
competing teams: “branding” and “direct response.” I was a kid who
wanted to play, but I wasn’t sure whose team I should join.

The people on the branding team made some really good points. They
believed that marketing should focus heavily on clean design, connection
with your audience, and creating a feeling that enticed people to come back
to buy from you over and over.
The direct response team had some very solid counter arguments that
made a lot of sense to me too. They focused their marketing efforts on
getting conversions, creating processes where you could track every
advertising dollar you spend, and working toward getting an immediate,
positive ROI.

In the end, though, because I didn’t have a ton of money to build a brand
and was financing everything out of my own pocket, I agreed more with the
direct response marketers and joined their team. I became obsessed with
conversion. I created pages, wrote copy, and ran ads that could out-convert
anyone. People would come, they would buy, and then they would leave;
those who bought usually never returned. However, as long as the money I
spent on ads was less than the money I made, I was winning the game.
But then Google changed. The PPC (pay per click) slap came, and my
ads disappeared overnight. The realization that all my cash flow had dried
up scared me enough to try almost anything to get traffic into my funnels. It
started me on a journey to search for any trick or hack I could try that
anyone had reported was working.

From the dozens of things we were trying, one seemed really promising.
At that time, the search engines valued backlinks that came from news and


PR websites. Writing and submitting a press release was an easy way to get
an awesome link that would help rank your website, and, if your press
release was good, you could actually get picked up by real press.

_How cool would that be?_ I thought. _One of my products could be on TV!_
I was in. I bought the courses to learn the strategies, Dream 100’d all the
PR sites I could find, built a list, and wrote and submitted press releases.
Some were free and others were paid, but 100 percent of the press releases I
submitted were rejected.

I didn’t know what I was doing wrong. It wasn’t that some of them were
rejected; all of them were rejected. I started contacting the sites’ editors to
find out why they all said no. It took a while to get through the gatekeepers,
but after getting inside, they all told me a similar version of the same story:
“At the end of the press release, you link to your website, but there’s
nothing there.”
“What do you mean ‘there’s nothing there’? That’s the squeeze page for
my funnel. It’s one of the highest converting pages I’ve ever created,” I
responded.

“I don’t understand what it is. It’s definitely not a website and looks like
some type of scam,” they replied.
_Scam? That page had made me more money than any website that their
other press releases had linked to._ In the end, though, they didn’t care. They
were used to seeing traditional websites. For me to be a legitimate business
in their eyes, I needed a legitimate website.

I began to funnel hack the websites that the other press releases were
linking to. While most of them had beautiful brands, none of them was
structured for conversion. The direct-response marketing legends whom I
learned from would have openly mocked me for even looking at these
beautiful, low-converting websites. I hated everything about these websites,
but at that point, I would have done almost anything to figure out how to
win the game and get their traffic. If it meant I needed to build a brand, I
was going to do it.
I dusted off some of the old branding books that I had buried at the back
of my bookshelf to see what I could learn. At first, the thought of creating
anything that wasn’t focused on optimization and ROI made my skin crawl.


However, I knew that if I wanted to get access to other people’s traffic, I
would have to play their game.

A few days into my study, I realized that by picking the direct response
team, I had thrown the branding baby out with the bathwater. Direct
response gave me the ability to bring in customers profitably, but branding
was what would get them to come back again and again. _DotCom Secrets_ is
based on my foundation in direct response, and _Expert Secrets_ is focused on
what I learned in my journey of branding and storytelling. I now believe
that having both branding and direct response blended together is essential
in today’s world, even more so than when I first started experimenting.
To get the approval from the PR agencies, I decided to create a new
website I could link to instead of replacing my funnels. This new website
would be used as a type of brand hub, where people could learn more about
me, my company, our products, and how we could help them. It looked
more like the traditional website that people were used to seeing, so my
hope was the press would be more willing to link to it. Once you clicked
into this brand hub, the links inside directed people into our front-end
funnels.


```
Figure 16.1: To get your funnel (left) accepted by PR agencies, you can create a funnel hub
(right) that has more content on it, yet it still drives people into your funnels.
```
At the time, it wasn’t very sophisticated, but it worked. I resubmitted my
press releases and they started getting accepted. After hundreds of press
releases had been accepted, my links increased, my hub moved up in SEO
ranking, and traffic started to flow. Because I had this site, it gave me more
credibility and I was able to get more traditional media to pick us up.

###### THE BIRTH OF THE FUNNEL HUB

I wish that I could say that over the past 15 years I put a huge focus on the
brand hub site that I had created, but unfortunately, I didn’t. While I
leveraged it to get traditional media, I never really understood its full
potential.
Recently, two of my Inner Circle members, Mike Schmidt and AJ Rivera,
wanted my opinion on something they had created called the “Funnel Hub.”


I trust them both a lot, so I blocked out some time to hear what they had to
say. Within about three minutes of them talking, I knew that they had
figured out the evolution of what I had tried to do 10 years earlier with my
brand hub site. They had thought it through at such a deep level that I had
them build a funnel hub for me as well, which I continue to use to this day.

In this chapter, I’ll be quoting from the conversation I had with Mike and
AJ to help you understand why a funnel hub should be a core part of your
traffic strategy.

**The Shadow Funnel**

Mike and AJ showed me some stats on a few of the funnels that we drive a
lot of paid ads to. He had talked to my traffic team previously, so he had an
idea of about how much money we were spending.
“Between these four funnels, you guys spent $485,927 last month alone
in ads on Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Instagram to sell your
products,” they stated.

“Yes, and we were profitable on every one of those dollars. All four of
those funnels broke even immediately, and we usually pull a profit, so
technically it didn’t cost me $485,000. I made money and got a ton of new
customers into my value ladder.”
“We know,” they said, “You’re the king of funnels. We’re not here to talk
to you about that. We’re actually here to talk to you about the shadow sales
funnel. The $485,000 that you spent sending people into your core funnels
created a huge shadow funnel that you’re not monetizing. In fact, many of
your competitors are building their companies on the back of your hard
work, and it’s not costing them anything.”


```
Figure 16.2: When we create a funnel, we assume most people will simply buy our product
after seeing it.
```
“What? I’m confused. What’s a shadow funnel?”
“The shadow funnel is the traffic that’s created in the wake of all the
traffic that you’re sending to your funnels. For example, when someone
sees an ad for any of your products, you’re capturing the percentage of
people that buy immediately. However, there’s actually a bigger percentage
of people who see your ad, and, regardless if they click through or not,
don’t buy. Instead, they might open a new tab and search for you in Google.
This is the beginning of the shadow funnel.

“Other times, they might hear a friend talk about you, hear you
mentioned in social or traditional media, hear you on a podcast, or hear one
of your fans or followers talking about your work. In any case, there are an
unlimited number of ways that this earned traffic and paid traffic that had
not immediately converted falls into your shadow funnel. Right now, you’re
just letting it fall by the wayside and hoping that somehow they’ll find you
again in the future.”


```
Figure 16.3: What actually happens is most people need convincing before they buy, so they go
through a “shadow funnel,” researching for more information about you and your products.
```
I was getting sick to my stomach thinking about how much traffic this
might have actually been for me.

Mike and AJ continued, “First, they’ll type in your name, then your
company’s name, and finally the product’s name. They’re looking for
ratings, reviews, and anything they can find to prove your credibility.
They’ll visit your blogs and social media accounts, including your
Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter profiles. They’ll join your lists, read your
emails, and listen to your podcasts. From this research, they’ll start to form
an opinion of your company. At this point, the ad that started them on this
journey is long gone, and when they’re ready to move forward toward your
value ladder, they’ll actively search for information on where to start.”
Then they showed me the number 251,680.
“What’s this?” I asked.
“That’s how many people worldwide in the past 12 months have searched
for ‘Russell Brunson,’” they said. “That’s the shadow funnel, and that’s just
your name. That doesn’t include your company or product names, and as
you continue to get more momentum, your shadow funnel will grow. Many
people try to rank for their dream keywords, but they typically forget about
their own branded names.


```
Figure 16.4: As I was busy trying to rank for non-branded keywords, I didn’t realize that over
250,000 people were searching for brand keywords like my name. Because I hadn’t set up
funnels for these branded terms, I was losing out on tons of traffic.
```
“When they search for your name, they land on random pages or funnels,
and you have no control over this user experience. They might land on a
page that is in the middle of your value ladder, and they won’t be ready for
it. Or, even worse, they might see pages from your competitors trying to
leverage the hard work and the money that you have been spending! You
need to take control of the shadow funnels that you’ve created and control
what people are finding when they search.”

###### YOUR FUNNEL HUB

After Mike and AJ scared me with their shadow funnel discussion, they
started to talk to me more about the funnel hub.
“From the outside,” they said, “it looks kind of like a website, but the
strategy is completely different. Its goal is to organize all the funnels and
offers in your value ladder in one place. When people start searching for
you, it’ll let you control what they find when they search; inevitably, it will
help you ascend people up your value ladder. It’s a central hub that
organizes all of your funnels and offers and gives you the look and feel of a


more traditional website to help build your credibility and magnify your
authority.”

They probably could tell I was loving everything they said, because at
that point, they smiled. “You know what else? In _Expert Secrets_ , you told us
to create a lot of things as we were designing our tribe. Things like:

```
Who is your Attractive Character?
What is your future-based cause?
What is your customer manifesto?
What does your value ladder look like?
What do you stand for, and what do you stand against?
```
“We always had those on a Google Doc, and we kind of knew what they
were, but our followers never knew. The funnel hub is the place where we
gather all these things together so people who are looking for us can quickly
understand who we are and how we can serve them.”
Then they said, “You’re publishing on so many platforms—your blog,
podcast, YouTube channel, Facebook pages, and Instagram accounts. Your
funnel hub can become your brand stream to organize all your media in one
place. This way, your followers can find all your published content from all
your platforms in one place.”

###### HOW TO CREATE YOUR FUNNEL HUB

As you can probably tell in this part of the story, I was sold on creating my
funnel hub. You can see my active funnel hub at MarketingSecrets.com. I
now build a funnel hub for each core company that I create.

Because most funnel hubs have a blog built into them, as well as pulling
in multiple types of RSS feeds and other types of media, we typically do not
build them on ClickFunnels (although you could if you weren’t going to
blog). We built ours in WordPress, which, in addition to being the most
popular content management platform in the world, is free.
Here is the basic layout of a funnel hub.


```
Figure 16.5: To build your funnel hub, you can add features such as a blog, RSS feed, social
posts, and front-end funnels.
```
Leveraging the funnel hub to take advantage of all your shadow traffic,
earned media, traditional press, and word-of-mouth advertising can be
huge. It’s simple to set up when you get started, and, as your brand grows,
your funnel hub will then be ready to capture all the traffic.


##### SECRET #17

### OTHER PEOPLE’S DISTRIBUTION

### CHANNELS

I’m going to share a little secret with you. I have a lot of entrepreneur
friends who watch _Shark Tank_ (as they should), and they believe for some
reason that each shark has the Midas touch where any business they touch
will magically turn into gold. You can see this belief in every pitch given
inside the Shark Tank. Entrepreneurs are willing to give up huge
percentages of their companies with the hope that one of the sharks
touching their company alone will cause it to explode.
I love _Shark Tank_. In fact, I’ve watched pretty much every episode of
_Shark Tank_ and its overseas sister show, _Dragons’ Den_. (Yes, I’ve watched
all the Canadian and U.K. versions as well.) I even ripped copies of Japan’s
version, The _Tigers of Money_ , but I couldn’t understand a word anyone
said. Regardless, I’m a shark, dragon, and tiger nerd, and I watch closely
the types of deals that each shark takes. For this example, I’m going to
focus on the U.S. version of _Shark Tank_ and some of the sharks you’re
probably more familiar with.

**Daymond John:** He built up the famous brand FUBU and spent his youth
building a distribution channel to sell clothing and other similar items to

retail.^47

**Lori Greiner:** She’s created over 700 retail products and built up a
distribution channel to sell products on TV through QVC, as well as
infomercials. She has also built strong distribution channels with most
major retailers.^48


**Mark Cuban:** He built up and sold Broadcast.com for $5.6 billion. He also
spent decades building online and offline media distribution channels,

which included his purchase of the Landmark Theaters in 2003.^49

I could go on and on with all the other sharks, but I’ll stop with just these
three to illustrate my point. As you watch the entrepreneurs pitch the
sharks, notice which deals each of the sharks bite on. Rarely is it a matter of
them picking any business knowing that their Midas touch will magically
make it successful. On the contrary, they pick businesses based on whether
or not they can plug them into their pre-built distribution channels.
Think about it. With every clothing deal that you see, yes, the sharks will
talk about it, but if Lori can’t see it on TV, or if Mark doesn’t have an
influencer with their own followers (distribution channel) that he can
instantly plug it into, they’ll find a way to say no. But when Daymond sees
a clothing deal, he knows that in just one phone call, he can plug that
product into his existing distribution channel and will get paid from that
connection for the rest of his life.

The same thing happens when someone pitches a product that would be a
good fit for Lori’s distribution channel. Notice how her eyes light up when
she can “see this product on TV” or “picture this at Bed Bath & Beyond.”
She owns a distribution channel, and if the product is a good fit, she plugs it
in.
The same is true with Mark and every other shark or dragon who has
ever been on the show. They each have built and mastered one distribution
channel, and they’re looking for products they can plug into it. That’s the
big secret.

People often ask me which types of businesses I invest in or which
partnerships I do, and my choices are 100 percent based on the distribution
channels that I know and understand. If I don’t know where someone
should buy their traffic, or which lists they should rent, or who could get
their site ranked, or who could make their video go viral, I’ll never touch
the project. I only take on projects that I know will work with 100 percent
certainty, and which I know will work because I already have a distribution
channel in place for them.


I shared this because you need to understand that each of your Dream
100 has a distribution channel; that’s why they’re on your Dream 100 list.
Each person has the Midas touch, and it’s your job to figure out how you
can plug your products into their distribution channels.

###### DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL #1: EMAIL SOLO ADS

We spent the whole first section of this book focusing on how you can build
up your own distribution channel by converting traffic that you earn and
buy into traffic that you own (your own list). There are hundreds of people
in almost every market who have already built up their own email lists, and
one of the easiest ways to quickly increase your traffic is to buy ads in their
email lists.

When I’m looking for email lists to buy ads in, I’m traditionally looking
for a solo publisher, someone who has already created their own brand and
list, where I can pay them to send out an email talking about my products or
services. You can also reach out to bigger brands that you can pay to send
out ads in their newsletters.
The solo publishers are likely already on your Dream 100, and it can be a
simple process to ask them if they are willing to sell a solo ad in their
newsletter. The ones who’ve had experience with this will typically say yes
and have some sort of base pricing. Bigger brands will usually have an
online media kit that lists their prices if you want to buy an ad in their lists
or on their websites.

You can also find a lot of advertising opportunities in email newsletters
by searching on Google. I’ll often type in “[my niche] email advertising” or
“[my niche] online media kit,” and I can usually find publishers that will
sell me a place in their email lists. I always join their lists for a few weeks
before I buy any ad so I can see how they treat their list. If they only send
tons of promotions, then I figure they beat up their list pretty badly and
they’re probably not the type of list I want to rent. However, if they send
out good stuff and have a good relationship with their list, then I’ll contact
them for a media kit. Not all clicks are equal. Fewer clicks from a
newsletter where someone has a good relationship with the publisher will


always be better than more clicks from someone who has a bad relationship
with their audience.

I wish I could give you a set pricing that you’ll typically pay, but it
almost always ends up in a negotiation, so keep in mind that their rates are
usually negotiable. They say, “suckers pay rate card,” and I tend to believe
this is true. Publishers will usually try to have you pay based on how many
people are on their list because that larger number serves them, but I would
prefer to pay based on how many clicks their emails typically get. To find
out that number, I’ll usually ask to see a report of the last 5–10 emails they
sent out and how many clicks each email got. Then I reverse engineer the
process by saying to myself, _If I were to get that many clicks, then based on
my normal landing page conversion rates, I should make “x” amount of
money._ This process helps me know approximately how much I’m willing
to spend to pay for that ad, and I try to negotiate toward that number.
After you negotiate the ad cost, you’ll create the email, send it to the
publisher, and then they’ll send out the email for you. If they want to send
you their email list and have you send the email out, then run away fast.
This is a scam and not something you should ever do. They should be
emailing their list from their servers with your creative that you gave them.
I like to have the email come from the publisher endorsing the landing page
that I want to send the reader to.

The best part about email ads is you get results really fast. When
someone sends the email, you’ll get the majority of all your clicks within 12
hours, the rest of your clicks within 36–48 hours, and then the clicks usually
stop. I like to use email campaigns to test landing pages because I can run
split tests really fast.
The worst part about email ads is you can waste a lot of money fast _if_
you’re not ready. I may spend $5,000 on an email drop, where the traffic
will all come and go fast, but if I spend that same $5,000 on Facebook, I
may be able to run traffic more slowly for a few weeks. So be aware of that
as you are running email ads.

Lastly, solo publishers will often try to sell you “sponsorship ads,” which
are smaller ads embedded inside their emails. I’m not a huge fan of these,
and I’ve had a really hard time getting them to be profitable. For me, if I


can’t buy a solo ad, meaning the entire email is my message, then I usually
won’t do it.

###### DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS #2 AND #3: FACEBOOK

###### MESSENGER AND DESKTOP PUSH

As of today, I don’t know many people selling ads in their Messenger lists,
but I do think that this market will start to grow. Usually, the messages that
are sent through Messenger need to be a little more stealthy because
Facebook doesn’t like you sending out straight promotions. Because
Messenger doesn’t allow you to send blatant promotions to your
subscribers, the open and click-through rates are second to none. I
recommend finding people in your Dream 100 who are actively building up
Messenger lists and asking them if you can buy ads to their lists.

The same is true with desktop push notifications. This is a newer type of
list that is getting a lot of traction right now. We’re starting to build up a
Dream 100 list of people in our market who are building up these lists so
we can purchase broadcasts from them.

###### OTHER DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

There are tons of different distribution channels out there that you will start
identifying as you keep your eyes open. Recently, we started going to all
our Dream 100 and buying postcard and direct mail campaigns to their
buyer lists. Sometimes it’s harder to get them to block out the time to send
an email, but most of them aren’t sending anything to their customers in the
mail. We’ve been setting up deals with them where they send their
customers’ shipping addresses to a secure mailing house (so we never
actually get access to their addresses) while we send a pre-approved mailing
piece to that mailing house. The mailing house will then print our letter or
postcard and then send it to the customer lists of our partners.
Some of my friends have built up big text message lists, so we’re buying
text blasts from them. Others run big Facebook groups, so we’re paying to
post a sponsored post in their groups. Others have big groups on LinkedIn,


so we’re paying the group owners to send messages to their followers for
us. And still others have large forums, so we’re buying promotions to their
customers’ user base and banner ads on their sites.

Most of the blogs in our market sell ads on their sites. Some have big
Google AdSense blocks, and we’ll test ads initially using GDN to see if the
ads convert well. If they do, I’ll go directly to the blog or website owners
and try to pay them to replace that AdSense block with my banner ads. I’ve
even paid people for their website exit pop-ups so I can tap into the traffic
that is leaving their websites.
There’s an unlimited number of ways to do this. The key is to keep your
eyes open for streams of traffic and distribution channels that people own;
then figure out how to buy ads in them. Each new distribution channel you
plug into will give you a raise. Every day when I come into the office, the
first thing I ask myself before I get out of my car is, “How can I give myself
a raise today?” Immediately, my mind will start looking for distribution
channels in my market that I can tap into. Sometimes I’ll remember a
website, a blog, or an email list that I’ve been on forever that I forgot about.
When your mind is looking for these opportunities, somehow they start
jumping out at you.

When you don’t have access to Facebook or Google ads (like we didn’t
for so long), the number-one way to get traffic is searching for these
distribution channels and using them to build up your own lists. It’s a
guerilla technique that works no matter what is happening in the networks,
and you can immediately start plugging this technique into your daily
routine.

###### INTEGRATION MARKETING

My first mentor, Mark Joyner, whom I introduced you to earlier in this
book, wrote a book called _Integration Marketing_ about a decade ago. It
shifted my mind-set from just finding distribution channels and buying ads
in them to figuring out ways that we could integrate into the actual sales
processes of our Dream 100.
For example, let’s say I find a partner who is getting 1,000 new leads into
their funnels every day. Instead of just buying an ad one time to that list,


what if my email was sent to every new lead on their email list on day
three? That way, I set up the deal once, but I get the benefit of that
integration every day. Now, every day 1,000 new people get my message.
I’m now integrated into my partner’s sales process, and as they grow their
company, mine grows as well!

```
Figure 17.1: When you integrate your funnel into other people’s funnels or email campaigns,
you get the benefit of having additional streams of traffic for as long as they are in business.
```
Integration marketing works beyond just email. We’ve set up deals where
we integrate a pop-up on people’s blogs so every reader the blog gets can
potentially join my list. We’ve set up other deals where we have people add
an exit pop-up to their website, so that when people leave their site, a big
percentage are sent over to our funnels! There are so many fun and creative
things you can do. Your imagination is your only limitation.

As soon as I became aware of this concept, I started looking for these
integration opportunities everywhere. I looked for products that people
would need immediately before they started using ClickFunnels, things like
domain hosting, graphic design, and business licenses. Then I figured out a
way to set up a partnership with each company. For instance, after a person
buys their domain, gets a logo design, or gets their business set up, they’re
introduced to us. We set up many of these deals years ago, and because


we’re integrated into our partners’ distribution channels, tons of customers
are driven to us every day without us having to do anything again.


##### SECRET #18

### YOUR AFFILIATE ARMY

I want to take you back in time to November 2003.

My wife had just closed her eyes, and I had finished a homework
assignment on my laptop in bed. Before I shut down the laptop for the
night, though, I decided to do one last search to hopefully give me some
direction on my side hustle. My wife had been working to support us both,
and we wanted her to be able to retire from her job and for us to start a
family. I had spent the last year trying to figure out how to play the
“business” game, but, no matter what, everything I had tried had led me to a
dead end.
I’m still not sure exactly what I typed into Google. All I know is that
after a few clicks, I ended up at the front page of an underground marketing
forum that was filled with thousands of people who were making money
online. I created a free account and instantly got access to a community of
people who were doing exactly what I had dreamed of doing. I had no idea
that anything like this existed online!

I started scrolling through the posts and saw people discussing the newest
Google algorithm changes, what things they were testing, what worked, and
what didn’t. I was eavesdropping on the conversations of internet
millionaires who were sharing everything so freely and had no idea I was
there!
For hours, I devoured every post and wrote down every resource. I
realized that the answer to every question I ever had was there, and these
people were the ones who were discovering what was working and were
sharing it in real time. I had found my people... my tribe! As the clock
changed from 10 P.M. to 11 P.M. to 12 A.M. to 1 A.M., every hour seemed like a
few seconds. I was so excited, but my body and eyes were so tired.


_I’ve got to read just one more post_ , I thought. _Just one more._ Afraid that
perhaps I was in a dream and if I woke up, I might lose access to this
exclusive club, I kept scrolling and reading. That’s when I looked over and
realized it was 2:47 A.M. Wrestling practice started at 6:00 A.M. _Do I go to
sleep now and get a few hours of sleep?_ I knew the answer was yes. I
needed to sleep, or I was going to really struggle to make it through
tomorrow.

I went to close my laptop, but then I saw it. The question. The golden
question! The one that I had been asking in my head over and over again for
the past few months.
_What’s the best way to get traffic to a website?_
I wanted to click on it, but I didn’t know if I had the energy to go down
that rabbit hole, at least not then. I looked at the question for at least 30
seconds and decided I had to know. I clicked on the title, and it brought me
immediately inside of an intense conversation with everyone talking about
why their way to drive traffic was the best.
Some said SEO, but then all the SEO guys started to fight over which
method of SEO was the most effective: cloaking, doorway pages, link
spam, log spam, and about two dozen other things I had never heard of.
Then the PPC guys came out as well. Each had a different strategy that one-
upped the person who posted before them. Others talked about email
marketing, safelists, or buying solo ads.

My heart raced faster and faster, and every new idea seemed better than
the last. And then it happened. The owner of the forum—probably the
wealthiest guy who was there—made a comment. It wasn’t long—just eight
words that stopped everyone in their tracks—the ultimate mic drop. These
eight words changed my life.
_I rely on my own network of affiliates._
At first it didn’t really make sense to me. I read it again and again.
Knowing that he was one of the best marketers in the group, I knew there
was something to it and that I needed to figure it out.
Then it hit me! He had an affiliate program that had hundreds of affiliates
who sold his products for him. Because he gave them a commission after
they made a sale, he had no risk; he only paid them if they actually made a
sale!


I looked at his response again: _I rely on my own network of affiliates_. I
saw his brilliance. Instead of relying on his own efforts to do SEO or PPC,
he could have dozens of others ranking pages for him and running ads
selling his products. Instead of relying on his own email list, what if he
found 10 or 20 or 100 affiliates who each had lists of tens of thousands of
people? Instead of his message getting sent to thousands of people, he could
reach millions.

The amount of leverage you get when you build an affiliate program and
rely on the efforts of other people is huge. It’s kind of like building a team
and hiring people to do these tasks for you, except when they’re an affiliate,
you don’t pay them for the work. Instead, you pay them commissions based
on the sale. They have the risk, and you both share the rewards!

```
Figure 18.1: You don’t have to be good at everything. You can get an army of affiliates to
promote your products and services with their preferred method of traffic.
```
That was the epiphany I was looking for. Instead of becoming the best
person in the world at driving traffic, I needed to create an opportunity for


the top affiliates to make money by promoting my products and services.
Then I could focus my efforts on recruiting, training, and paying them.

Throughout this book, we’ve spent a lot of time talking about the Dream
100, and this is where it starts. If you’ve been building out your Dream 100
within each platform, you have your potential army of affiliates ready. This
chapter will then focus on five steps:

```
1. Recruit your army of affiliates
2. Make them affiliates
3. Give your affiliates a reason to promote
4. Train your affiliates to become super affiliates
5. Compensate your affiliates
```
###### STEP #1: RECRUIT YOUR ARMY OF AFFILIATES

If you’ve been following the Dream 100 process, then you’ve already
created lists of your potential affiliates. If you’ve been digging your well
before you’ve been thirsty, then you’ve been building relationships with
them. If you haven’t yet, I’d recommend going back and starting that
process as soon as possible. Every Dream 100 person has their own
distribution channel. Some have an email list, others have a following on
Facebook or Instagram, others have a podcast with a lot of subscribers, and
some have more than one of those channels.
We’ve talked about working your way into their audiences as well as
buying your way in. Asking your Dream 100 to be an affiliate is blending
both of these things together. You have to work your way in to build
relationships and to get people to say yes to promoting, but then you have to
pay your way in for each sale they make. When someone is an affiliate,
though, it takes the risk off you. You’re no longer buying ads and hoping
they convert. Instead, your Dream 100 is promoting you, and you only pay
them after they’ve made the sale.

So how do you turn your Dream 100 into an army of affiliates? The first
thing you have to do is ask them to be an affiliate, even though asking is
oftentimes the hardest part. If you’ve been digging your well with your


Dream 100, and if you have a relationship with them, you should know the
projects and ideas that they are working on. In return, they should also
know what things you’re working on.

Tim Ferris, author of _The 4-Hour Workweek_ , spent over a year getting to
know some of the most influential bloggers in the world _at the same time_ he
was writing his book.^50 He started digging his well before he was thirsty.
When they asked him what he did, he would tell them that he was writing a
book. After he finished the book and was ready to launch it, he sent out
over 1,000 pre-release copies to the bloggers he had met. He also asked
them to write a review about the book on launch day. Most of these people
loved his book, so on launch day, a huge percentage of them wrote blog
posts about it to their followers. Tim’s army of affiliates helped to send his
book into bestseller status overnight.

Every time we have a big launch coming out, we let our affiliates know
the launch date, and we ask them to block it out on their calendar. In a
typical launch, I may ask 100 people to promote. Thirty people will usually
say yes, yet just 15 or so of them will actually promote. It’s just a numbers
game, and often it doesn’t fit into their promotional schedule at the time.
Don’t take it personally; just know that the more people you ask, the more
likely you’ll get the yeses you need to have a good launch.
One strategy we often use (that was pioneered by Chet Holmes and made
famous by Dana Derricks) is to send out packages to our Dream 100 telling
them about the promotions we have coming up. Each package could be
worth thousands, and in some cases, one yes could be worth millions from
the right partner. Because of this, we spend a lot of money sending out cool
stuff in the mail to recruit affiliates. The key is getting their attention and
giving them a reason to promote.

As you’re recruiting affiliates to sell your product, it is important to
understand that there are different types of affiliates, each with a different
motivation. Some are only concerned by how much money they make and
want a high-converting funnel, while others are more concerned with
whether or not the product is a good fit for their audience. For me, I don’t
care what their motivation is. I just want to serve their customers, so I want
to make sure they’re happy at all costs. Since one yes from one of them


could bring hundreds of your dream customers, it’s worth putting in a lot of
effort to build these relationships.

###### STEP #2: MAKE THEM YOUR AFFILIATES

After your Dream 100 has said they want to be an affiliate, you have to
make it official by getting them to join your affiliate program. Inside
ClickFunnels there is an affiliate platform called Backpack that you can use
to add an affiliate program to any funnel inside of your ClickFunnels
account. You just need to turn it on for a funnel, and it will create a page
where your Dream 100 can sign up to become an affiliate. Within the
software, it will provide tracking links for your funnel, track their sales, and
pay their commissions. We’ve created an extensive training inside
ClickFunnels on how to set up your affiliate program. Go to TrafficSecrets.
com/resources to find it.

Often, your best affiliates will be your customers. I always like to let my
customers know that they can actually make money by referring their
friends. You can put links to your affiliate sign-up page on your funnels, on
your thank-you pages, and in your emails. That way, you are helping them
to earn commissions on the products they already love and helping them to
spread your message.

###### STEP #3: GIVE YOUR AFFILIATES A REASON TO PROMOTE

Once someone is an affiliate, you need to give them a reason to promote.
They could promote millions of products, so you need to explain why they
should promote your products, and, more importantly, why they should
promote you now. Usually, we’re able to get affiliates to promote based on
one of three things:

```
A new launch
Their turn on a rolling launch
Something special or new
```

**A new launch:** Launching a new product is one of the easiest ways to get
affiliates to promote because you can tell them about the new project that
you’ve been working on, send them copies of the product in the mail, and
let them experience what you’re going to be selling. We usually roll out two
to three new front-end products each year that we ask affiliates to promote.
We set a launch date and start recruiting affiliates 60–90 days before each
launch. We send out Dream 100 packages, call them on the phone, send
emails, and do whatever else we need to do to have them block out our
launch dates on their calendars. The earlier you can ask them to dedicate
time to your launch, the better, so they can make sure they don’t have any
other promotional conflicts.

As we get closer to the launch date, we’ll typically put everyone who has
agreed to promote into a special Facebook group where we can
communicate with them about everything that’s happening in the launch.
This helps to build a community of affiliates and create a fun competitive
environment where we share leaderboards and give people multiple reasons
to promote during the launch.

**The rolling launch:** A rolling launch is similar to a new launch, but instead
of everyone promoting on one single launch date, you let people each have
their own turn to do a launch to their lists. This is how we initially launched
ClickFunnels. Once I knew my webinar converted, instead of having
everyone promote it at once, I set up special webinars for each affiliate. I
would do two to three of these a week for a few months. This rolling launch
gave us the ability to work with each affiliate to find a time in their own
promotional calendar that would work.
The longevity of a rolling launch is a lot longer. For a typical product
launch, there is an opening day and a close cart day, and affiliates who
couldn’t promote during that time missed out. Also, a huge launch can often
lead to too many new customers too fast, which might clog up your
customer support. A rolling launch gives you the ability to onboard new
customers at a much easier pace.

**Something special or new:** Often I’m recruiting affiliates who don’t want
to be part of a product launch. They may be SEO marketers, or they may be
really good at PPC, or they may want a higher commission because they’re


so good. There could be dozens of different reasons, but my goal is to be
able to serve their customers, so I’ll work with them individually to see
what is best for them. I may set up a special landing page, a different offer,
a higher commission, or whatever else they need that will give them a good
reason to promote for me.

###### STEP #4: TRAIN YOUR AFFILIATES TO BECOME SUPER

###### AFFILIATES

As you’ll soon find, the better the affiliate is, the lazier they often are; and
the worse the affiliate is, the more training they’ll need. Both of these
became problems for us. New affiliates didn’t know what to do or how to
promote us; the good affiliates knew how to do it but wouldn’t promote
unless we made the process very simple for them. (Good affiliates make a
lot of money and have a lot of people begging for their attention.) In both
cases, nothing would happen. To solve this problem, we created affiliate
training centers that had two goals:

```
Show new affiliates how to promote our products. We trained them
how to run ads, track their sales, and more.
Offer copy-and-paste ads that our super affiliates could grab and
quickly edit. We gave them sample email ads, banner ads, copy for
Facebook posts, and more.
```
With Backpack (inside of ClickFunnels), you can create an affiliate
center. The affiliate center is one of the most powerful tools you can have in
your traffic arsenal because it’s easy to create an affiliate center for each of
your funnels.


```
Figure 18.2: Your affiliate center is a place to give your affiliates as many assets and as much
training as possible for them to be successful.
```
###### STEP #5: COMPENSATE YOUR AFFILIATES

“How much should I pay my affiliates?” This is the question I get the most,
and one that I get hit with the most resistance toward when I tell people my
philosophies. While most people are always asking how little they can pay
their affiliates, I want to figure out ways that I can pay them the most


possible. The more you’re able to pay your affiliates, the more likely they
are to promote you. They’re your commission-based sales team, and
affiliates who are good have unlimited opportunities to sell anything they
want. They don’t need you; you need them.

When we first launched ClickFunnels, I noticed that most of the other
software companies were paying their affiliates 20–30 percent commission
on their sales. We launched immediately with a 40 percent commission for
our affiliates, and because of that, we were able to recruit most of their top
affiliates. They stopped promoting the other software products and started
promoting ours.
At the time, I started watching how many top network marketing
programs bought cars for their top recruiters. After reviewing our own
affiliate program at ClickFunnels, I realized that if one of our affiliates
brought in 100 ClickFunnels members at $100 per month, then 5 percent of
those commissions ($500) would equal enough to cover the lease payment
on a dream car. So we added a bonus in our affiliate program: we would pay
any affiliate an extra $500 each month to pay for their dream car if they had
more than 100 people signed up under them and $1,000 per month toward
their dream car if they signed up 200 people.

These few things alone helped us to get some of the top affiliates in the
world to start promoting us. I didn’t want to stop there, though; I wanted to
figure out how to pay them more. Shortly after we launched the
ClickFunnels affiliate program, we started launching new front-end funnels
that our affiliates could promote. The first one was the _DotCom Secrets_
book, where people could pay $7.95 shipping to get a copy of the book, and
then we would upsell the audio book and other related courses. We set it up
so affiliates would earn 50 percent of all sales that came from that funnel,
and when they upgraded to ClickFunnels later, we would also pay them
their 40 percent recurring commission on those sales.
We did this for the first three weeks of the book launch, and then we
started looking at our stats. We noticed that for each person who bought the
book, we were making about $20 in sales from the upsells. It was also
costing us about $20 to give away the book for free from our own Facebook
Ads. (If you remember, we were okay with that because it was a break-even


funnel. And we were okay with losing money as long as we could push
them back into ClickFunnels.)

Then we had an idea. Instead of paying people a percentage of sales in
that book funnel, what if we gave them a flat CPA of $20 for every book
they sold? We wouldn’t make any money, and in some cases, we could lose
some money, but it would incentivize our affiliates to promote harder. So
that’s what we did the last week of the launch. We paid $20 for every free
book our affiliates gave away, and our army of affiliates sold tens of
thousands of copies of that book! We broke even, our affiliates got paid, and
from that promotion alone we got thousands of new ClickFunnels members
for free!
As you can see, there are two core ways you can pay affiliates. The first
is to pay out a percentage of the sale, and the second is to pay them a flat
CPA for every sale they make.

My rule is that I try to pay out 50 percent of the profit I make in my
funnel. For instance, if I have a digital product or a course, I assume my
fulfillment costs will be about 20 percent of the sale, so I split the remaining
80 percent with the affiliate who brought in the sale. If I’m selling a
physical product and my costs of goods sold are 60 percent, then I only
have 40 percent profit, and I’ll split that with the affiliate right down the
middle. If I have a front-end funnel, then I’ll usually give 100 percent (or
more) to the affiliate to really motivate them to fill the front of my value
ladder with my dream customers.
There have even been times that we’ve paid $80 or more on a free book,
because we knew that within a few weeks of sale, we would be profitable. I
recommend staying at or below 100 percent commissions on any front-end
offer until you’ve mastered your numbers and know the actual lifetime
value of your customers and are okay to float the money for a few months
while the customers are going through your follow-up funnels.

Building a successful affiliate program has brought us more traffic, leads,
and sales than any other marketing technique. If you pay your dues with
your Dream 100, recruit them to be an affiliate, treat them well, and always
figure out more ways to make them money, they will keep your funnels
filled with your dream customers. If I turned off all other traffic techniques
that we’ve been using and only use this one, I’d still have an army of people


buying Facebook Ads for me, sending out emails for me, ranking websites,
and buying ads. Make this a priority and it will serve you for the rest of
your life.


##### SECRET #19

### COLD TRAFFIC

Thus far, I’ve focused on two types of traffic: warm traffic (the fans and
followers and lists of your Dream 100) and hot traffic (your own list). For
most companies, this is all that you will ever need to focus on. I strongly
believe that you can build most companies to multiple eight figures a year
just by focusing on warm traffic and then turning it into hot traffic. If you
want to scale beyond that, though, you’ll have to master one other type of
traffic: cold traffic.

In _DotCom Secrets_ , I called this “traffic temperature,” and it’s a concept
that I started to understand after first hearing this amazing quote from the
late Eugene Schwartz:

```
If your prospect is aware of your product and has realized it can
satisfy his desire, your headline starts with the product.
If he is not aware of your product, but only of the desire itself, your
headline starts with the desire.
If he is not yet aware of what he really seeks, but is concerned with
the general problem, your headline starts with the problem and
crystallizes it into a specific need.^51
```
```
Figure 19.1: Prospects are at different stages in their awareness of the problem, solution, and
product based on the temperature of the traffic.
```

To me, it meant that traffic that was cold needed to be spoken to
differently than traffic that was warm or hot because they weren’t even
aware that a solution existed, let alone that there was a product to solve
their problem.

Most of the landing pages, offers, and ads that you’ve created up to this
point are for people who are solution aware or product aware. They know
they have a problem, they’ve tried a bunch of solutions, and you’re
presenting them with a new opportunity that will get the results that they
want. Because they are already aware of the potential solutions, have done
some research, and have probably tried a bunch of your competitors, when
you have a chance to hook them and tell them your story, they already have
a context for the problem you’re trying to solve for them.
For example, in my market, many of my customers have a problem: they
want to make more money. To solve that problem, they could try any
number of solutions: they could set up an e-commerce store, sell things on
eBay, learn SEO, master Facebook Ads, or do about a hundred other things.
They’re aware of all the possible solutions, so I have to show them that my
solution (funnels) is a new opportunity that trumps all the others. If they’re
product aware, they’ve probably heard of all my competitors, so I have to
convince them that my product is superior, and then they will buy it from
me.

Cold traffic, on the other hand, often isn’t even aware they have a
problem. If you remember the three core markets, cold traffic is a group of
people that are at the 3 Core Desires level. All they know is that their
health, wealth, or relationship isn’t good; they don’t have any understanding
yet of anything beyond that. They haven’t been congregated into groups
yet, so no one is helping them. If they are aware they have a problem,
they’re still at the beginning of their journey and have no idea what to do or
where to turn. Anything presented to them at this point has to be filled with
a lot of education to get them ready for what you have to offer.


```
Figure 19.2: Often, cold traffic is only aware that their core desire (such as health, wealth, or
relationships) isn’t good.
```
Getting something to work in cold traffic will seem difficult, but it’s
actually as simple as changing your language patterns. To illustrate this, I’ll
share a test we use to see if something will work well with super cold
traffic. Imagine I walk into the food court at the mall and see 300 people
sitting at tables, eating lunch and minding their own business, completely
unaware of what I’m doing. If I stood on top of a chair and shouted from
the top of my lungs, “Hey! Who here would like to grow their companies
using sales funnels?”, what do you think would happen? You guessed it:
they’d probably look at the crazy guy on the chair for a second and instantly
go back to eating. Chances are almost no one would raise their hands. But if
I pulled up that same chair and I changed what I yelled at the top of my
lungs to “Who here wants a moneymaking website?” I bet half the food
court would raise their hands.

Interestingly enough, the solution to both these problems is that they
need a funnel, but to the people who are more unaware, my language
doesn’t make sense to them. The difference in talking to hot, warm, and
cold traffic is the language that you use. “Funnels” don’t make sense to the
masses, so I have to change my language to “money-making website” to
match what they would understand. After I have their hands raised, I can
educate them on a certain type of website called a funnel, and I can help


them to become solution aware. Finally, after they’ve warmed up, they’ll be
more willing to make a purchasing decision.

If you create a funnel that converts really well to warm traffic (the
followers of your Dream 100) and your hot traffic (your own lists), it might
not convert well to cold traffic. You see, no matter how much cold traffic
you get, you’ll probably go broke before you even get a single customer.
You have to create a different type of funnel that speaks to where they are
and then warms them up. Let me show you how it works.

###### STEP #1: CREATE YOUR “COLD TRAFFIC CUSTOMER

###### AVATAR”

The first step in this process is to create a new “cold traffic customer
avatar.” This avatar will be similar to your current dream customer avatar,
but cold traffic is much earlier in their journey. They are six months to a
year (or more) before they became your dream customer. They know they
have pain in the three core desires that you serve (health, wealth, or
relationships), but they haven’t started moving toward a solution yet. These
people can become your dream customers, but right now they are only
_problem_ aware. They are unhappy because they know there is a problem,
but they’re not yet aware of the solutions that are possible and they’re
definitely not aware of any products that will solve their problems. They
only know what the problem is and the results they want.
To identify this cold traffic customer avatar for myself, I had to look deep
into my own past. For most of you, if you’ve followed a traditional
entrepreneurial journey, this avatar will mostly likely be you five to ten
years ago. Think about it: most entrepreneurs have struggled with the desire
of health, wealth, or relationships and went on a journey to get themselves
out of pain. During this journey, they fell in love with their own process of
change, and they became obsessed with helping others out of the same pain
that they once had. This is how most entrepreneurs find their mission.

If that’s true for you, you need to look back in time to where you were
struggling with that same problem that your cold market clients are
experiencing right now. For me, I have to think back almost 30 years ago to
12-year-old Rusty (yes, that’s what my parents and all of my friends called


me back then). For some reason, as a 12-year-old, I had one desire: I
wanted money. I’m not sure why. I had a great childhood and nothing was
lacking, but for some reason my core desire was for wealth.

This desire caused my problem: I didn’t have any money. And how did I
try to solve this problem? Well, it started with me ordering Don Lapre’s
course on classified ads from a late-night infomercial. (I shared this story at
length in _DotCom Secrets_ .) It was the first vehicle (submarket) that I
learned about, and I was hooked. I saved up my money to try to buy
classified ads.
Shortly after I was introduced to one of the submarkets (making money
with classified ads), I started to become aware of a lot of them. One day I
was at the grocery store, saw a magazine called _Small Business
Opportunities_ , and begged my mom to buy a copy for me.

Inside of the magazine were dozens of ways to make money (lots of
submarkets), and each had a way to request an information kit to learn
more. I called every 1-800 number, requested every kit, and within weeks
started getting hundreds of letters and packages in the mail, each offering a
new way to help me achieve the result I thought I wanted.
One kit showed how to get rich selling gold chains at the mall. The next
showed how to get rich painting glow-in-the-dark stars on people’s
bedroom ceilings. Others showed how to get rich in real estate, the stock
markets, or commodities trading. Because I was only aware of my problem,
each message pitched me on the potential solutions for my problem (i.e.,
different ways to make money).


```
Figure 19.3: There are many different opportunities all leading to the same result (making
money).
```
Every day when I came home from school, my parents would have a pile
of “Rusty’s junk mail” that I would grab and take into my room. I opened
every letter, read every sales pitch, and tried to understand which ones
would help me get the result I thought I wanted. Some of the pitches I
would just throw away, and others would keep me up at night as I tried to
figure out how I could convince my parents to give me money to order their
opportunity. Still others were so good that I would mow lawns and do
chores or anything else possible to get enough money to purchase their
information.
Later on in life, it would take me a while to remember what it felt like
reading all those sales pitches, but after I put myself back in those moments,
my 12-year-old self became my customer avatar for cold traffic. Now every
time we create an ad, pick our targeting, design our landing page, and make
an offer for cold traffic, I try to go back in time and look through the lens of
12-year-old me.

Is this ad something that would make Rusty click, or would I keep on
scrolling? Is this offer something that would cause Rusty to beg his parents
for their credit card, or better yet, force him to earn money because he had
to have it? Or was this something that he would have just thrown in the
trash?
So my question for you is this: What is your version of 12-year-old
Rusty? What were the things that would have grabbed your attention at the
beginning of your journey? What words and phrases would you have used
back then to explain what it is you’re doing now? If I had seen words like
“funnel” or “traffic” back then, I would have kept flipping through the
magazine. Instead, they had used words that described the problem I had
and the result I was trying to get in a way that I understood, and _that’s_ why
they were successful.

###### STEP #2: CREATE A BRIDGE


Marketing is all about creating bridges from what someone wants and
desires to the solution that you provide. In _DotCom Secrets_ , I shared this
image showing the seven phases of a funnel, where phase one is the traffic
temperature and then phase two is the pre-frame bridge.

```
Figure 19.4: The warmer the traffic, the smaller the pre-frame bridge needs to be.
```
As you can see, the warmer the traffic, the smaller the pre-frame bridge
needs to be. If your audience knows, trusts, and loves you (the hottest
traffic), then your bridge could be as simple as telling them you have
something cool that you think they should buy. At our last Funnel Hacking
LIVE event, we had 4,500 funnel hackers in the audience—by far my
hottest traffic—and I asked them, “If I told you to buy something right now,
how many of you would trust me enough to just walk to the back of the
room without knowing what it was, but you’d do it because you believed
me?” Over 60 percent of the room shot their hands up in agreement.

That is the power of hot traffic and the reason why the game becomes
easier and easier as you focus your efforts on tapping into your Dream
100’s hot traffic (your warm traffic) and converting it into traffic that you
own. The traffic that you own becomes your hot traffic. Can you see now
why I stressed the goal of converting warm traffic that you can earn and
control into traffic that you own so much?
As you move down the warm traffic bridge, it takes a little longer to
bridge the gap between what people already know and believe and what
you have to offer. Sometimes that bridge is an email from your Dream 100
endorsing you. Other times it’s a presell content video that people watch on
Facebook or YouTube warming them up to you and providing value before


you direct them into your funnels. And other times, the funnel alone is
structured to be the actual pre-frame bridge that warms them up.

The last and longest bridge is the cold traffic bridge. But how long does it
need to be? It all depends on how cold the targeted customers are. The first
time I tried to grow past our Dream 100’s customers and figure out cold
traffic, I took a segment of my customer list and ran some intense data
analysis on who our existing customers were. If you want a company to do
this for your customer lists, go to TrafficSecrets.com/resources to find an
up-to-date list of companies that you can hire.
When we got back the data, we found a lot of interesting trends, but one
that really stuck out was that a huge percentage of our customers at the time
were conservative Republicans. The report even referenced a few of the
websites that this group spent a lot of time on.

Excited to find a new segment that I had never targeted, I went to these
websites (as well as other similar sites) and found that most of them had
online media kits that allowed me to buy ads in their email newsletter as
well as banner ads on their websites. I put in an order to send an email out
to 2.3 million people that would direct them into our funnel that converted
warm traffic. I was doing the math in my head, and based on what I knew at
the time (how big their list was, how many clicks I should get, and how my
warm traffic funnel normally converted), I figured this email alone would
make me a few hundred thousand dollars.
Once the publisher sent the email, I watched as hundreds of thousands of
clicks came to my funnel. That excitement quickly turned to horror,
however, as these people almost immediately bounced off and didn’t buy.
When the campaign ended, we had made about a dozen sales, and I had lost
over $30,000 from the ad. I was defeated, and I swore I’d never look at cold
traffic again.

Then something interesting happened. I had joined these email lists
before I paid for the ad because I wanted to see my email when it hit, and
each day afterward I started seeing how other people who were marketing
to these lists were doing it. I started clicking on their ads, and slowly I
started to funnel hack them. The links didn’t take me immediately to a
funnel, which didn’t make sense to me. Instead, the links took me to a page
that looked similar to the site that I had just been on. It looked less like a


funnel and more like an article. I read the article, and, within a few minutes,
I saw something I hadn’t before. This article was speaking a very different
language than I was. It was speaking directly toward the conservative
Republicans it was targeting, using their language, and telling stories about
things that they believed in and cared about. Then, within those stories, it
started to bridge the gap between what the conservative Republicans
believed and what the advertiser was offering.

Toward the end of these articles was a link to join a newsletter that would
give you more information. I clicked on the link and joined that newsletter.
I noticed that for most of these cold traffic bridges, they didn’t sell anything
to me for a while. I got newsletter number one in their follow-up funnel,
which continued to bridge concepts and beliefs with me through stories.
Within a few messages, they started to transition and push me into their
front-end funnels. At this point, even I was ready to buy.
They didn’t take people directly from a cold ad into a warm funnel.
Instead, they took them through a warming-up process to prepare them for
the warm funnel. After I saw that, I was ready for round two!

```
So we spent time trying to figure out:
```
```
What language patterns (words and phrases) should I use to explain
what I’m trying to warm people up for?
What false beliefs do people have that would keep them from buying
when they did see my funnel?
What stories did I have that could bridge the gaps and break their false
beliefs?
What content pieces did we need to create to tell these stories?
```
We then wrote an article landing page which would become our cold
traffic pre-frame bridge. When we bought our next solo ad to the list, we
sent all the traffic to this article page. From the article page, we directed
them to a lead funnel that captured their email address, and then we built a
follow-up funnel that led them to different posts on our blog, videos on
YouTube, and other places where we had strategically placed content to
warm them up. Eventually, we introduced them to our front-end offer after
we had warmed them up.


The results? We were able to finally get cold traffic to work! Typically
with warm traffic, we try to break even immediately during the first funnel
we direct them toward, but with cold traffic, it takes longer because it’s a
much longer bridge. With some sources, we’re able to break even within a
week, but others take two to three months or longer. That’s why it’s so
essential that if and when you break outside your Dream 100, you already
have a solid value ladder in place with follow-up funnels and sequences that
convert. If you’re able to get your offers to convert to cold traffic, then you
can buy ads almost anywhere, including buying ads in colder email lists and
banner ads on most websites.

In order for most companies to scale past nine figures per year, you’ll
need to master cold traffic. To begin with, though, I’d still focus all your
efforts on warm traffic and the Dream 100. I always tell people that there is
a huge pile of cash sitting in front of you, waiting for you to go and grab it.
Don’t step over it while trying to go after bigger piles of cash somewhere
else. Stop and grab the big pile of cash (your hot and warm traffic) first, and
then after you have it all, you can start looking more at the cold traffic
channels.


##### SECRET #20

### OTHER GROWTH HACKS

To conclude, I’m going to share some other fun ways to get traffic into your
funnels. I could keep adding more chapters with more ideas, but at some
point, this book would become too big to consume. Instead, I’ll use this
chapter to help stimulate more fun ideas and growth hacks that you and
your team can use to start brainstorming other ways to get traffic into your
funnels.

My close friend and fellow early marketing pioneer Mike Filsaime
pioneered a concept over a decade ago that he called “butterfly
marketing.”^52 Basically, he believes that tiny changes in your marketing can
produce huge results. It is cause-and-effect applied to marketing online.

I had heard people talk about the butterfly effect when I was in school. I
still remember my teacher talking about how something as small as a
butterfly flapping its wings in a certain location could cause a tiny, almost
imperceptible change in the environment that, when combined with other
changes in the weather system, could be indirectly responsible for a
hurricane forming on the other side of the world. But how do butterflies
relate back to digital marketing? Mike argues that there are a lot of little
things you can do inside of your sales funnels that, while seemingly small
and insignificant, could have a massive impact after virally compounding
over time.
Mike spent a lot of time trying to figure out which things you could plug
into your sales funnel that would get the people who came to your funnels
to refer other people for free (word-of-mouth marketing). To make
something truly viral, you had to get past a referral point that Mark Joyner
calls “copulation rate,” or the rate that your viral marketing is growing.


In other words, if you referred 100 people into your funnel and relied 100
percent on viral marketing from that point forward, and if these 100 people
each referred less than one person, then your growth would quickly die. If
they each referred exactly one person, then your viral growth would flatline.
However, as soon as each person you referred brought in more than one
person, then you would have something that would be truly viral.

```
Figure 20.1: To have something go viral, you need each person to refer more than one person.
```
Now, getting to a true copulation rate is very hard, and it’s impossible to
sustain forever because eventually you would have everyone in the world.
Eventually, you hit a saturation point and the viral growth will slow down
and eventually stop.

I’ve only had one funnel that hit a true copulation rate of greater than
one. It was a front-end funnel we built to recruit people into a new network
marketing company that we were helping to launch. This funnel required
people to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), and then they got five
invite codes to invite others into the funnel. After they referred five people,
they would then be given five more invite codes.
We modeled this based on how Google initially launched Gmail. They
gave each Gmail user the ability to invite a limited number of people onto
the platform. Invites became so valuable that people were selling them on

eBay for over $100 each!^53


Our viral front-end funnel signed up over 1.6 million people in just six
short weeks. During these six weeks, we averaged three new sign-ups for
every one person who joined the site, and I had a chance to see true viral
growth. Unfortunately, the company this funnel was promoting didn’t have
everything ready for the launch, and they had to delay three or four times,
pushing the launch out to over nine months later. People got bored and the
viral growth slowed to a stop.

Now, most of us are probably not going to have the chance to have a site
that has true viral growth, and that’s okay. There are still plenty of things
that you can do inside your funnels to promote true viral, “refer a friend”
style growth, where you can turn your traffic into more traffic. I’ll share
with you a few ideas from companies that you know that may give you
ideas of things you can weave into your funnels.

**Dropbox:** When users signed up for an account with Dropbox, in their
upsell flow Dropbox offered to give the new member more free storage if
they linked their Twitter and Facebook accounts and shared information
about Dropbox on those accounts. This helped Dropbox grow to over 500
million members worldwide!^54

**Facebook:** When people first created their Facebook accounts, they were
encouraged to add all their contacts so Facebook could see if these people
were already on the site and connect you to them. Then Facebook took all
the people who weren’t on the site and sent emails inviting them to join

Facebook from the new member.^55

**Hotmail:** In the early years of Hotmail, Hotmail added a signature line to
every email that went out that said “PS: I love you. Get your free email at H
otmail.com.” That little hack helped them to get to 12 million users in just
18 months.^56

I had heard stories of some of these famous growth-hacking companies,
so as we launched ClickFunnels, we started to weave some of these
concepts into our sign-up flow. Here are a few of the things that we tested
that were successful.


**ClickFunnels + Dropbox’s growth hack:** After someone created their
ClickFunnels account, we gave them a limited account that only had the
ability to create up to 20 funnels. Then we gave them an affiliate link with
an opportunity to double their funnels from 20 to 40 when they referred a
new user to ClickFunnels. This helped our members to bring in more
members.

**ClickFunnels + Facebook’s growth hack:** We didn’t have the capability to
have people import their friends and then send them emails, so we had to be
creative to figure out how we could model this growth hack. At the time,
we were sending a lot of traffic to webinars that would teach people about
ClickFunnels. On the webinar, we would present people with an offer to
create their free 14-day trial account. We had an idea to plug in a “tell-a-
friend” script in the page after someone registered for the webinar. Once
they referred five friends to the webinar they’d just signed up for, they
could get a free copy of one of our best-selling products. We found that the
majority of our visitors would refer their friends just so they could get a free
copy of the product. Typically, we’d get about 20 percent or more of our
sign-ups for each webinar from those sign-up referrals. That extra 20
percent was free traffic we didn’t even have to pay for.

**ClickFunnels + Hotmail’s growth hack:** As we were launching
ClickFunnels, we knew that people would eventually create millions of
pages online. To capitalize on this, we attached a badge on the bottom of
each page that says “This Page Made with ClickFunnels.” The badge was
coded with the page owner’s affiliate link, which took the viewer to
ClickFunnels. Because we made every ClickFunnels member an affiliate
when they signed up, every ClickFunnels user had the ability to make
affiliate commissions when other people clicked on that badge and signed
up for ClickFunnels. We gave people the ability to turn the badge off, but
by default it was turned on. Over the past five years that we’ve had the
badge on our members’ pages, we’ve added over 10,000 members and
currently make over $1,000,000 per month in recurring revenue (over $12
million per year) from that one growth hack.

Each of these growth hacks that we have implemented into our funnels
have been tiny little changes that produced huge results. We’ve had others


that we’ve tested that didn’t have a big enough impact to report here, but I
wanted to tell you the stories of the more successful ones so that you’ll start
noticing them as you’re going through other people’s sales processes. As a
funnel hacker, you should be closely watching the sign-up processes
through this growth-hacking lens. See the creative things people are doing
that you can model inside your funnels, and then test the ones that you like.

This is a marketing game of hunting for buried treasure. Just think, that
one tiny badge we placed on our members’ pages, almost as an
afterthought, pays us over $12 million per year. Each of these little
butterflies, growth hacks, or whatever you want to call them, has the ability
to change the metrics of your company forever. Start looking at marketing
and traffic as a game, and keep your eyes open for the next million-dollar
hack that’s right in front of your face!


## CONCLUSION

###### TYING IT ALL BACK TOGETHER

I know that this book hasn’t been light reading. Unlike most books on
traffic that focus on one platform or one strategy, I didn’t want to just give
you a tactic that only worked today and maybe not tomorrow. I wanted to
give you a framework that you could use to get traffic from any platform,
today, tomorrow, and forever. My goal wasn’t to give you a fish; my goal
was to teach you how to fish, and I hope I did just that.

This book is the final book in my Secrets trilogy. For some of you, this will
have been the first book of mine that you’ve read because traffic was the
thing you felt you were missing most in your company. Traffic is just one
part of the equation, though. If the traffic you’re sending into your funnels
from the strategies in this book isn’t working, then you typically either have
a funnel strategy problem (that can be diagnosed and cured with the
information inside _DotCom Secrets_ ) or you have a conversion problem
(which can be solved by mastering the concepts inside _Expert Secrets_ ).
Using these three books together will help you to have a more holistic
approach to your online digital marketing strategy.

Now that you’ve finished the book, you’re probably asking yourself, “What
should I do next?” This book was created to be like a playbook that you
don’t just read once, but one that you can reference over and over again.
Each concept builds on the one before it, and after you master it in one
platform, you can layer on another platform as you work toward complete
conversation domination.

For right now, though, this is what I recommend you do while these ideas
and concepts are still at the top of your mind:

```
Decide on who you really want to serve. If you really want to fill your
funnels with your dream customers, you have to know and understand
them better than they understand themselves.
Pick the platform you want to publish on first. This will probably be
the platform that you personally spend the most time on now, because
```

```
you’ll understand how to communicate in the unique language of that
platform the best.
Build your Dream 100 list of the people who have already
congregated your dream customers on this platform.
Start digging your well with your Dream 100. Figure out ways to
serve them and start working your way in.
At the same time, learn the tactics of how you can buy your way in on
that platform.
```
This is where you should start and focus 100 percent of your energy until
your funnel has hit the Two Comma Club, meaning it’s made at least $1
million. At that point, layer on a second platform and then a third. With
every dollar you make online, reinvest a big percentage of your profits back
into advertising. Finally, don’t stop. Traffic is the lifeblood of any company,
and consistent lead flow is the secret to a healthy business.

Every day, look at ways that you can give yourself a raise. Ask yourself:
“How can I get more traffic?” “Who can I connect with on my Dream 100
today?” “What new integration opportunities are there?” “Are there new
people whom I can add to my Dream 100?” “How can I get them to
become an affiliate?” “What can I do to incentivize them to promote?”
“How can I get them to promote more often?”

All these questions stem from my primary question of “How can I give
myself a raise every day?” Ask that question, and flip through the pages of
_DotCom Secrets_ , _Expert Secrets_ , and this book to find your answers. These
playbooks weren’t created based on ideas but rather on battle-tested
principles that I discovered after spending over 15 years in the trenches.
These are the ideas that stuck and that work consistently.

I hope that you can use these secrets to find more of your dream customers
and serve them at your highest level. They are waiting for you to find them
so you can change their lives. If you focus on that, your business will
become a catalyst of change for people in their lives, and that’s the real
purpose behind business.

Thank you for allowing me to serve you through these pages and this
series. It’s truly been an honor, and I can’t wait to see what you do with the


frameworks that you’ve learned. Come hit me up on any of the social
media platforms, say hi, and please share with me how these “secrets” have
changed your life.

Thanks,

Russell Brunson

P.S. Don’t forget, you’re just one funnel away...

### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

It was August 17, 2004, and I was on a family vacation at a little lake with
my young bride. It was at a time before smartphones were created and the
internet hadn’t made it to the lake yet. I felt very disconnected from the
world. It was really nice.
I had just started my little business a few months earlier and I was still
trying to figure out what I was even doing. Curious if anyone had emailed
me or tried to buy something from me during this trip, I decided I needed to
get online and check my email.

Late one afternoon, I took a drive to find somewhere that I could access
the internet. I drove around the small town and finally found a library that
was about to close. There was a sign outside that said they had access to the
internet, so I jumped out of my car and snuck in a few minutes before they
asked everyone to leave.
I walked over to one of the computers and logged in to check my email.
As I was waiting for it to load, I started to get nervous, hoping that I hadn’t
missed anything important. When the inbox loaded, I saw about a dozen
new messages.

Most were ads, none were from customers, and then I saw one email that
stood out. The subject line said _WE DID IT!_ and the message was from a
guy named John Reese, one of the early internet marketing pioneers that I
was following.
_We did what?_ I wondered as I opened the email.
Inside, the email stated, _We broke the record we had set out to
accomplish_. I wasn’t sure what record he was talking about, so I continued
to read.
_We set out a goal to make 1 million dollars in a day, with the launch of
my new product called Traffic Secrets. We spent the last few months_


_creating this launch campaign, and today it went live. In just 18 short
hours, we passed our goal of a million dollar in sales!_

I was shocked. I sat back in my chair and I read that sentence over and
over. A man, someone who was just a few years older than me, had made
more money in a day than I thought was possible for me to make in my
lifetime. If he could do that... then what could I do? What was actually
possible?
Then I looked at the name of his product: Traffic Secrets. About that
same moment, the people at the library asked us all to leave because they
were closing the doors. After leaving the library, and for the rest of the
week, all I could hear in my head were the words “traffic secrets.” If he
knows how to get enough traffic to his website to make a million dollars in
a day, I had to know his secrets. I knew that traffic was the key that I didn’t
have yet, and it was the missing ingredient that I needed in my business if I
wanted it to be successful.

That started a journey that I have been on now for over 15 years: to learn
how to get traffic (i.e., people) into my website and funnels. During this
process, I’ve had a chance to learn from so many people, I could never
name them all.
People like Mark Joyner, who taught me the power of an email list and
the strategies for how to grow them; Chet Holmes, who introduced me to
the concept of the Dream 100 that became the framework for how we get
traffic today; Dan Kennedy and Jay Abraham, who taught me the
foundation of direct response marketing; and, of course, John Reese, who
was the first to teach me all his traffic secrets on multiple platforms.

Since I started this journey, I’ve had some amazing partners who have
taken these ideas and run with them in different departments of our
company. Brent Coppieters and later Dave Woodward helped to find,
recruit, and train our affiliate army that drives more traffic into our funnels
than all other sources combined. John Parkes, who jumped in to learn
Facebook Ads for us a few years ago and eventually built a huge media
buying team with people running paid ads for us on Google, YouTube,
Pinterest, Twitter, Snapchat, and more, as well as organic traffic on all the
major platforms. They are testing and innovating these strategies on a scale
that few people have ever even dreamed up.


Each tactic, every strategy, came from conversations I had with other
amazing entrepreneurs and marketers. It would be impossible to remember
where every idea came from, but I’ve tried throughout this book to give
credit to the original person I learned each concept from to the best of my
memory.

I also want to thank everyone who helped me to write this book. I don’t
think people would believe the countless hours that go into a project like
this until you embark on one yourself. I want to give a special thanks to Joy
Anderson, who helped to edit the book, made sure my thoughts and ideas
were clear, kept us on schedule, worked with the designers, and helped take
this book across the finish line. Thank you for all the extra time you put in
to help make this a masterpiece.
I have one last special acknowledgment that I want to make. During the
Expert Secrets book launch, I had decided that I was not going to write
another book. Literally a few hours later, I got an email from John Reese
asking me if I would like to purchase the brand and the domain name Traffi
cSecrets.com. My heart jumped, and instantly I knew that this was the final
book in the series. It was the last essential set of secrets and frameworks
that I needed to arm my entrepreneurs with if they were going to have long-
term success with their companies.

I quickly told John yes, and a few days later the domain was in my
account and I started to work on this project. I want to thank John for
allowing me to keep the Traffic Secrets legacy alive. If he wouldn’t have
created belief in me 15 years ago that all of this was possible, there is no
way I’d be here in this position now sharing these secrets with you.
